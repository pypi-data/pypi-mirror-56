    [`bug 1837468 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1837468>`_]
    Fixed unit.actions.openstack.test_generator.GeneratorTest.test_generator
    failure by avoid triggering version discovery as it needs to talk to
    Keystone server. Talking to a live Keystone server is not needed for
    this particular unit test.
