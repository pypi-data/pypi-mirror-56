        **27/11/2019 v0.0.6**
        
        >>> fix some variable usage errors, so now calling ``init`` command should work, without any problems.
        
        
        **13/11/2019 v0.0.5**
        
        >>> `build` now calls `python(3) setup.py build`, and `sdist` is added for `python(3) setup.py sdist`
        
        >>> All commands now, which use `python` as command, check for default python version.
        
        
        **12/11/2019 v0.0.5**
        
        >>> New option ``--debug`` is added, so when some error occur, user can check the whole stack trace.
        
        >>> ``venv`` is added as command, so now after creation of the project, new virtualenv can be created.
        
        >>> Each command now has its own file, in the folder commands. (sceleton > commands)
        
        >>> Some style fixes.
        
        
        **13/10/2019 v0.0.4**
        
        >>> Initializing/Adding/Removing packages is fixed.
        
        
        
        **13/10/2019 v0.0.3**
        
        >>> Now installing of packages should work without specifying names of any package.
        
        >>> Virtualenv is removed from `setup.py` as needed dependency from the package, because by default python's venv is used.
