PyPROS, precipitation type calculation: rain or snow
===================================

The PyPROS package applies several algorithms to estimate the precipitation type and discriminate it among rain, sleet and snow. 

Given an air temperature and dew point temperature fields a precipitation type field can be obtained. In addition, if a reflectivity field is supplied, the precipitation area is masked.

Installation
============

To install pyPROS you can have a look at [pyPROS installation](https://pypros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) documentation.

Use
===
Different precipitation type discrimination strategies are implemented in this package. More information in [pyPROS documentation](https://pypros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

A set of examples were designed to explore the different possibilities of PROS.

Another repository was created to store sample data and the examples in jupyter notebooks [pypros-examples](https://github.com/meteocat/pypros-examples)
