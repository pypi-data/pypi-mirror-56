# aiok8s

This a client library meant for building asynchronous Kubernetes controllers
using Python. It currently integrates with
[`kubernetes_asyncio`](https://github.com/tomplus/kubernetes_asyncio).

Most of the code is directly translated from and attributed to
[`client-go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go). This approach is taken
to help ensure that the logic is battle-tested and reduce overhead in
maintaining the library. It's meant to replicate only some of the most
desirable tools of the library, not all of it.

This is in early development. APIs may be adjusted or even removed.
