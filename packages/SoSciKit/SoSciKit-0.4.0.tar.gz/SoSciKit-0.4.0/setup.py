            ## Social Science Kit - Open Source Software for Social Science
            
            SoSciKit is a web application for simplified data analysis based on Python scientific libraries and Flask.
            The web application allows to use the python libraries through a graphical interface even to those who do not know programming language. At the moment the application allows to perform monovariate, bivariate, cross tabulation and k-mean classification operations. In addition, it allows to recode categorical variables and create typologies.
