class ProgramSchedule(AProgram):
    """
    A mode schedule provides for each time during a day the defined mode program. A day is divided into 15 minute
    slots. To each slot one of the mode programs is assigned. A schedule entry must not be another schedule. A
    schedule chart (see ScheduleImage) is generated that is published to a nikippe.mqttimage microservice for display
    purposes.

    Note: to create an instance of ModeSchedule, a two step initialisation is necessary: first call to constructor and
    as soon as all mode instances have been created, the method map_schedule_modes must be called. Calling
    get_program_at_time or publish before map_schedule_modes results in runtime errors.
