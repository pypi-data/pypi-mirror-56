[[File:C Monk.gif|right]]
Monks devote their energies to the pursuit of physical perfection, shaping their very bodies into deadly machines. Monks are a melee class with the ability to wear leather armor, wield blunt weapons, and use unarmed combat styles.

Monks forego heavy armor and almost all weapons in order to hone themselves into masters of combat, using their fists and a stout staff to make their mark upon Norrath. Monks learn many special attacks to enhance their damage dealing abilities, including the dragon punch and the legendary flying kick.

In their martial studies monks also learn other useful skills, including the ability to move silently and fall safely from great heights. Experienced monks also learn to feign death, slowing their body's functions enough to fool most observers into believing them dead - this trick often allows the monk to escape dangerous situations as monsters wander off, thinking the monk defeated.

Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else. Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone. The monk is a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat and leading groups in their dungeon adventures.

= Creation Guide =

== Picking the Right Race ==

The first thing you have to pick then is your race.   Which race you pick will determine the foundation of you character for the rest of your life in Norrath so it is kind of important you pick one you like.

[[Human]]s level 20% faster than Iksar Monks, and have slightly more base hitpoints.  They can enter all good cities in Norrath, but they have no night vision and lower dexterity and agility than the Iksar.  Humans can do slightly more damage than Iksars at their full power, though this is only true when using Hand to Hand (without [[Celestial Fists]]).

[[Iksar]]s have an innate boost to their armor class (AC) which stacks with the natural Monk AC boost.  They also have faster health regeneration, infravision, and the ability to forage (although this ability is capped). They also start with 100 skill in swimming.  Because of all these bonus abilities they do slightly less damage than Humans at their full power, though this is only true when using Hand to Hand (without Celestial Fists).  They are generally killed on sight in all cities but [[Cabilis]], and level 20% slower than Humans. If you're min-maxing, Iksar is the clear choice, as regeneration is very important for soloing, pulling and living with FD up.

== Starting Statistics ==

[[File:monk-stats.png]]

== Spending Your Bonus Points ==

The normal allocation is '''+20 Stamina'''.  Stamina keeps you alive while pulling, which is a monk's primary role, and with good gear it's relatively easy to cap Strength, Dexterity, and Agility even without much gear.  A shaman can stack [[Maniacal Strength]] and [[Focus of Spirit]] for about +120 STR/DEX and [[Avatar]] is +100 STR/DEX/AGI if you neckbeard hard enough to get a [[Sleeper's Tomb]] key.  In contrast, Shamans can only raise Stamina by 50.

The pure leveling choice is '''+20 Strength''', which is probably good for about +4% damage while leveling up and very marginally better than stamina.  But Project 1999 Blue is so mudflated at this point that everyone levels pretty easily regardless.  20 STR really only makes sense for human monks on a fresh server where gear is rare, leveling is hard, and Kunark/Velious gear is far on the horizon.

The super end game choice is '''+20 charisma''' to help with [[Divine Intervention]] as with enough BIS gear you'll cap everything without any starting points.  In general, end game Velious gear makes stat allocation pretty irrelevant for all classes.  The only important thing is rolling Human! or Iksar.
- No one is ever going to cast DI on a monk, just put your starting points into stamina.
== Experience Statistics ==

*Human Monk: No modifier
*Iksar Monk: -20%

'''What does it mean?'''

Certain races and classes require differing amounts of experience points to attain the same level. For example, an Iksar Monk requires 120% of the experience that a Human Monk would require to be the same level.

== Religion ==

Monks get little choice religion wise. Iksars must choose Cazic-Thule.  Humans have the ability to be agnostic or to follow Quellious.  There are not any good cities which would ever kill them for following this religion, and they will always be killed on sight in the evil ones.  Your choice of religion will determine your starting city: agnostic Monks begin in Qeynos, while Monks who follow Quellious will start in Freeport.

''See also: [[Disciplines]]''

* Disciplines all run off the same timer currently.  They were not changed to separate timers until many expansions later on live.  What this means is if you use Stonestance Discipline (12 min timer), all Disciplines will be unavailable until that 12 minutes are up.

= Weight Penalty Guide =
As of the January 31, 2016 patch [http://www.project1999.com/forums/showthread.php?s=2322986a02d5d9b01b1a0956526cd819&t=227019], the weight limits are the same as on live.  Before this patch, the client was inaccurate.  Now, the AC shown by the client is misleading due to mitigation and avoidance being conflated into one number, but it should be accurate for determining the limits.  They are now as follows:

{| class="eoTable2"
! Level Range
! Weight Limit
|-
| Level 1–14
| 14.9
|-
| Level 15–29
| 15.9

'''Q: My Feign Death isn't giving me an error message (Soandso has fallen to the ground), but the agro isn't dropping.'''

A: You need to make sure you stop auto attacking before using FD. A macro with "/attack off" in the first line and your Feign Death with "/doability #" in the second line will do this for you!
