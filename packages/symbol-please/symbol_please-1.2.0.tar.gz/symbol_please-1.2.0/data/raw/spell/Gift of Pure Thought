| description = Calms your group's thoughts, allowing them to regenerate mana more quickly. This spell is identical to [[Clarity II]], but it affects your whole group.

Also, as an added point of information, everyone in a group within appropriate physical range regardless of level can receive any group buff, so long as the caster does not have a lower level targeted when trying to cast the spell. Meaning, a level 1 can receive this buff.
