| description = Evacuates your group to the Greater Faydark.  While faster casting than normal portal spells, it is more likely to leave one or more of your group members behind. This is a good general purpose panic button for grouped wizards, as the gfay wizard spires are safe for all characters.

<strike> If this spell is cast in Greater Faydark, the group will be evacuated to the Kelethin POD lift rather than the wizard spires. </strike> - This bug has been fixed.
