| description = Places your target into a state of torpor, healing 300 hit points every six seconds for 24 secs (between 4-5 ticks), but vastly decreasing their movement speed and attack rate. This spell has the potential to tick a 5th time, totaling 1500 hit-points, depending on when it lands on your target (similar to how dot ticks work). The overall mana efficiency is 7.5 or 6 hp/m.
