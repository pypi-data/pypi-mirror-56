| description = Evacuates your group to the Nektulos Forest.  While faster casting than normal portal spells, it is more likely to leave one or more of your group members behind.  

<strike>If this spell is cast in Nektulos Forest the group will be evacuated to a spot near Neriak, rather than the wizard platform.</strike> This bug has been fixed.
