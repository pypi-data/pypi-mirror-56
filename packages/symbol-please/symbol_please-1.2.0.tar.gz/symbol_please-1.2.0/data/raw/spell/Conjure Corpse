| spellname = Conjure Corpse
| spellicon = U
| description = Summons your target's corpse to you. Consumes a [[Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin]] when cast. The advantage over the [[Summon Corpse]] spell is that the reagent is lighter weight at 0.1 and stacks to 20, rather than being a 10 weight container requiring a bag slot.

Note: If the target is not a group member, then a Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin is consumed anyway, but the corpse is not summoned.
