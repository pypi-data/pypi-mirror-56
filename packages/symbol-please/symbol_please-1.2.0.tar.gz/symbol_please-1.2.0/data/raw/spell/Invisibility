| spellname = Invisibility
| spellicon = B
| description = ''Cloaks your target in a mystic veil, making them invisible to many creatures.''

<br>

* Must grouped with your target.<br>
* This spell is comparable to the Druid's [[Superior Camouflage]] or the Necromancer's self-only [[Gather Shadows]].
* Players may see invisible players and NPCs with [[See Invisible]] and similar spells.
* All forms of invisibility are incompatible with pet ownership, summoned pets will be dismissed and charmed pet will break their charm spell.
* All un-improved invisibility spells can randomly break early, sometimes mere seconds after casting. As such, invisibility should be treated as a method for mitigating risk of aggro, not eliminating it completely.
| classes = 

* [[Shaman]] - Level 29
* [[Wizard]] - Level 16
* [[Magician]] - Level 8
* [[Enchanter]] - Level 4
