| spellname = Cripple
| spellicon = I
| description = Saps your target's power, decreasing their agility, dexterity, strength, and armor class for 6.3 mins @L53 to 7.0 mins @L60.

It's not a bad idea to cast this on raid targets who have dangerous procs, rampages, or flurries as it reduces the frequency of those attacks. It does generate significant aggro, however.

Stacks with [[Suffocate]].
