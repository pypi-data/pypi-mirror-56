| description = Evacuates your group to the Southern Desert of Ro.  While faster casting than normal portal spells, it is more likely to leave one or more of your group members behind.  

<strike>If this spell is cast in Southern Desert of Ro the group will be evacuated to a spot near the Oasis zone, rather than the wizard platform.</strike> This bug has been fixed.
