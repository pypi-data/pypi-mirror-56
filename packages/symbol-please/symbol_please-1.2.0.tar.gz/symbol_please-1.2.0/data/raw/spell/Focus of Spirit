| spellname = Focus of Spirit
| spellicon = K
| description = Focuses your target's spiritual energy, granting increased hit points, strength, and dexterity for 1 hour(s) 40.0 mins. <br> This spell has an unusual stacking mechanic. If a character has Focus, it will block the addition of [[Maniacal Strength]] and [[Mortal Deftness]] spells. ''However'' if the character already has [[Maniacal Strength]] and [[Mortal Deftness]] buffs prior, the addition of Focus on top of those will not overwrite them, rather it will stack and both will apply to the character's statistics. Therefore, if a melee character would like all three buffs, they should click off any pre-existing Focus, then ask the [[Shaman]] for them. 
<br> Focus of Spirit will always overwrite other Talisman spells however. It also seems to overwrite lower level spells such as [[Dexterity]].<br><br>
Does not stack with [[Shield of the Magi]]. Does stack with [[Resurrection Effects]].
