| description = Evacuates your group to the Western Plains of Karana.  While faster casting than normal portal spells, it is more likely to leave one or more of your group members behind. <strike>If this spell is cast in the Western Plains of Karana the group will be evacuated to a spot near the Qeynos Hills zone line, rather than the wizard platform.</strike> - This behavior has been fixed in a previous patch on p99.
