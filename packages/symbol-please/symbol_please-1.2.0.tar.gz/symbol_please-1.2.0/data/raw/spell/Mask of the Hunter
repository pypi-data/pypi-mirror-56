| spellname = Mask of the Hunter
| spellicon = T
| description = Covers your face in the mask of the hunter for 3 hours @L60, allowing you improved vision, increased mana regeneration, and the ability to see invisible creatures. Does not stack with Form of the Howler.

Note about the magnification effect: it's not magnification like a spy glass, rather it increases your field of view. The FOV effect, along with the size increase, is temporary and will be removed if you zone or camp; the mana regen and see invis remains for the full duration of the buff.
