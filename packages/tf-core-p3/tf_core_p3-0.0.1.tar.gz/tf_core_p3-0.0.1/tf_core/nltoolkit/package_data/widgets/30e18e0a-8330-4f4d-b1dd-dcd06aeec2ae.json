      "description": "    The Treebank tokenizer uses regular expressions to tokenize text as in Penn Treebank.\r\n    This is the method that is invoked by ``word_tokenize()``.  It assumes that the\r\n    text has already been segmented into sentences, e.g. using ``sent_tokenize()``.\r\n\r\n    This tokenizer performs the following steps:\r\n\r\n    - split standard contractions, e.g. ``don't`` -> ``do n't`` and ``they'll`` -> ``they 'll``\r\n    - treat most punctuation characters as separate tokens\r\n    - split off commas and single quotes, when followed by whitespace\r\n    - separate periods that appear at the end of line\r\n\r\n        >>> from nltk.tokenize import TreebankWordTokenizer\r\n        >>> s = '''Good muffins cost $3.88\\\\nin New York.  Please buy me\\\\ntwo of them.\\\\n\\\\nThanks.'''\r\n        >>> TreebankWordTokenizer().tokenize(s)\r\n        ['Good', 'muffins', 'cost', '$', '3.88', 'in', 'New', 'York.',\r\n        'Please', 'buy', 'me', 'two', 'of', 'them', '.', 'Thanks', '.']\r\n        >>> s = \"They'll save and invest more.\"\r\n        >>> TreebankWordTokenizer().tokenize(s)\r\n        ['They', \"'ll\", 'save', 'and', 'invest', 'more', '.']\r\n\r\n    NB. this tokenizer assumes that the text is presented as one sentence per line,\r\n    where each line is delimited with a newline character.\r\n    The only periods to be treated as separate tokens are those appearing\r\n    at the end of a line."
