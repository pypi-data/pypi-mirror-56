Description: # Strategy Editor SDK
        
        This repository contains an SDK for writing Python strategies for the margin application
        found at [margin.io]().
        
        This package is available for Python 3.6 or higher through pip
        ```
        pip install margin-strategy-sdk
        ```
        
        You can import all classes and functions in your strategy by calling
        ```
        from margin_strategy_sdk import *
        ```
