=====================
Changes in glymur 0.5
=====================

Changes in 0.5.12
=================

* Minor documentation fixes for grammar and style.
* The functions removed in 0.5.11 due to API changes in OpenJPEG 2.1.0 were
  restored for backwards compatibility.  They are deprecated, though, and will
  be removed in 0.6.0.

    * ``glymur.lib.openjp2.stream_create_default_file_stream_v3``
    * ``glymur.lib.openjp2.opj.stream_destroy_v3``


Changes in 0.5.11
=================

* Added support for Python 3.4.
* OpenJPEG 1.5.2 and 2.0.1 are officially supported.
* OpenJPEG 2.1.0 is officially supported, but the ABI changes introduced by
  OpenJPEG 2.1.0 required corresponding changes to glymur's ctypes interface.
  The functions 

    * ``glymur.lib.openjp2.stream_create_default_file_stream_v3``
    * ``glymur.lib.openjp2.opj.stream_destroy_v3``

  functions were renamed to 

    * ``glymur.lib.openjp2.stream_create_default_file_stream``
    * ``glymur.lib.openjp2.opj.stream_destroy``

  in order to follow OpenJPEG's upstream changes.  Unless you were using the
  svn version of OpenJPEG, you should not be affected by this.


Changes in 0.5.10
=================

* Fixed bad warning issued when an unsupported reader requirement box mask
  length was encountered.

Changes in 0.5.9
================

* Fixed bad library load on linux as a result of botched 0.5.8 release.
  This release was primarily aimed at supporting SunPy.
