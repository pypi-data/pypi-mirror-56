Description: # ocrd_segment
        
        This repository aims to provide a number of [OCR-D-compliant processors](https://ocr-d.github.io/cli) for layout analysis and evaluation.
        
        ## Installation
        
        In your virtual environment, run:
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
          - extracting page images (including results from preprocessing like cropping, deskewing or binarization) along with region polygon coordinates and metadata:
            - [ocrd-segment-extract-regions](ocrd_segment/extract_regions.py)
          - extracting line images (including results from preprocessing like cropping, deskewing, dewarping or binarization) along with line polygon coordinates and metadata:
            - [ocrd-segment-extract-lines](ocrd_segment/extract_lines.py)
          - comparing different layout segmentations (input file groups N = 2, compute the distance between two segmentations, e.g. automatic vs. manual):
            - [ocrd-segment-evaluate](ocrd_segment/evaluate.py) :construction: (very early stage)
          - repairing layout segmentations (input file groups N >= 1, based on heuristics implemented using Shapely):
            - [ocrd-segment-repair](ocrd_segment/repair.py) :construction: (much to be done)
          - pattern-based segmentation (input file groups N=1, based on a PAGE template, e.g. from Aletheia, and some XSLT or Python to apply it to the input file group)
            - `ocrd-segment-via-template` :construction: (unpublished)
          - data-driven segmentation (input file groups N=1, based on a statistical model, e.g. Neural Network)  
            - `ocrd-segment-via-model` :construction: (unpublished)
