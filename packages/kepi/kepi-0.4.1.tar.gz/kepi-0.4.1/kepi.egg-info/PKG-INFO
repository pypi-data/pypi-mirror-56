Description: kepi
        ====
        
        kepi is an ActivityPub daemon.
        
        [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) is a standard protocol
        for integrating social media across Internet sites.
        
        For example, you might post an article. Someone else on another site
        might reply to it, and someone else might "like" it. Someone else again
        might "follow" you, in order to get notifications when you post
        anything else.
        
        kepi runs in the background on your server, distributing your messages
        to other sites, and receiving their responses.
