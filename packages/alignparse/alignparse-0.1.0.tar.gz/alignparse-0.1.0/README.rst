Align sequences and then parse features.

``alignparse`` is a Python package written by `the Bloom lab <https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html>`_. 

This package is designed to align long sequencing reads (such as those from PacBio circular consensus sequencing) to targets, filter these alignments based on user-provided specifications, and parse out user-defined sequence features. For each read that passes the filters, information about the features (e.g. accuracy, sequence, mutations) is retained for further analyses. 

The source code is `on GitHub <https://github.com/jbloomlab/alignparse>`_.

See the `alignparse documentation <https://jbloomlab.github.io/alignparse>`_ for details on how to install and use ``alignparse``.

To contribute to this package, read the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.rst <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
