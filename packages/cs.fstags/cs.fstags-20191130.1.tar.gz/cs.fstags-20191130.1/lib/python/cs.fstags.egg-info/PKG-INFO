Description: *Latest release 20191130.1*:
        Initial release: fstags, filesystem based tagging utility.
        
        Simple filesystem based file tagging.
        
        Tags are stored in a file `.fstags` in directories
        with a line for each entry in the directory
        consisting of the directory entry name and the associated tags.
        
        The tags for a file are the union of its direct tags
        and all relevant ancestor tags,
        with priority given to tags closer to the file.
        
        For example, a media file for a television episode with the pathname
        `/path/to/series-name/season-02/episode-name--s02e03--something.mp4`
        might obtain the tags:
        
            series.title="Series Full Name"
            season=2
            sf
            episode=3
            episode.title="Full Episode Title"
        
        from the following `.fstags` files and entries:
        * `/path/to/.fstags`:
          `series-name sf series.title="Series Full Name"`
        * `/path/to/series-name/.fstags`:
          `season-02 season=2`
        * `/path/to/series-name/season-02.fstags`:
          `episode-name--s02e03--something.mp4 episode=3 episode.title="Full Episode Title"`
        
        Tags may be "bare", or have a value.
        If there is a value it is expressed with an equals (`'='`)
        followed by the JSON encoding of the value.

        ## Class `Tag`
        
        A Tag has a `.name` (`str`) and a `.value`.
        
        The `name` must be a dotted identifier.
        
        A "bare" `Tag` has a `value` of `None`.
