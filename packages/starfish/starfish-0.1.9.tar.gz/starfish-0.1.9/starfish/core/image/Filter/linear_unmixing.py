class LinearUnmixing(FilterAlgorithm):
    """
    LinearUnmixing enables the user to correct fluorescent bleed by subtracting fractions of the
    intensities of other channels from each channel in the ImageStack.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example provides a coefficient matrix that corrects for spectral
    mixing in a 3-channel experiment.
    Channel 0 contains a mixture of itself plus 50% of the intensity of
    channel 2. Channel 1 has no mixing with other channels. Channel 3
    consists of itself plus 10% of the intensity of both channels 0 and 1.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> coeff_mat = np.ndarray([
    ...     [1,    0,  -0.1]
    ...     [0,    1,  -0.1]
    ...     [-0.5, 0,  1   ]
    ... ])

    The end result of this unmixing will be that 50% of channel 2 will be subtracted from
    channel 0, channel 1 will not be changed, and 10% of channels 0 and 1 will be subtracted
    from channel 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coeff_mat : np.ndarray
        matrix of the linear unmixing coefficients. Should take the form: B = AX, where B are
        the unmixed values, A is coeff_mat and X are the observed values. coeff_mat has shape
        (n_ch, n_ch), and poses each channel (column) as a combination of other columns (rows).
    clip_method : Union[str, Clip]
        (Default Clip.CLIP) Controls the way that data are scaled to retain skimage dtype
        requirements that float data fall in [0, 1].
        Clip.CLIP: data above 1 are set to 1, and below 0 are set to 0
        Clip.SCALE_BY_IMAGE: data above 1 are scaled by the maximum value, with the maximum
        value calculated over the entire ImageStack
        Clip.SCALE_BY_CHUNK: data above 1 are scaled by the maximum value, with the maximum
        value calculated over each slice, where slice shapes are determined by the group_by
        parameters
