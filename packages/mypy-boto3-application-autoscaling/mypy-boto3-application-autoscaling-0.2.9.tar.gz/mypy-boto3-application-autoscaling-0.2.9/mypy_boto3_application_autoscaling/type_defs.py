          adds to the current scalable dimension while a negative number removes from the current
          scalable dimension.

    - **MinAdjustmentMagnitude** *(integer) --*

      The minimum number to adjust your scalable dimension as a result of a scaling activity. If the
      adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` , the scaling policy changes the scalable
      dimension of the scalable target by this amount.

      For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service
      by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the service has 4 tasks
      and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a
      ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service by 2 tasks.

    - **Cooldown** *(integer) --*

      The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes where previous
      trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events.

      For scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been
      added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the
      desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not
      excessively) scale out. For example, an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to scale out an
      Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown
      period of 5 minutes starts. During the cooldown period, if the alarm triggers the same policy
      again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the service by 3 tasks, the 2
      tasks that were added in the previous scale-out event are considered part of that capacity and
      only 1 additional task is added to the desired count.

      For scale-in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until
      it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's
      availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during the cooldown period
      after a scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

    - **MetricAggregationType** *(string) --*

      The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are ``Minimum`` , ``Maximum`` ,
      and ``Average`` . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as ``Average`` .

    - **PolicyType** *(string) --*

      The scaling policy type.

    - **StepScalingPolicyConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A step scaling policy.

      - **AdjustmentType** *(string) --*

        Specifies whether the ``ScalingAdjustment`` value in a  StepAdjustment is an absolute number
        or a percentage of the current capacity.

      - **StepAdjustments** *(list) --*

        A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach.

        - *(dict) --*

          Represents a step adjustment for a  StepScalingPolicyConfiguration . Describes an
          adjustment based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch metric
          and the breach threshold that you've defined for the alarm.

          For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

          * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than
          60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

          * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to
          50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

          There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

          * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

          * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a
          negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

          * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a
          positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

          * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

          - **MetricIntervalLowerBound** *(float) --*

            The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch
            metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive
            (the metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound).
            Otherwise, it is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower
            bound). A null value indicates negative infinity.

          - **MetricIntervalUpperBound** *(float) --*

            The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch
            metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive
            (the metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is
            inclusive (the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound).
            A null value indicates positive infinity.

            The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

          - **ScalingAdjustment** *(integer) --*

            The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value
            adds to the current scalable dimension while a negative number removes from the current
            scalable dimension.

      - **MinAdjustmentMagnitude** *(integer) --*

        The minimum number to adjust your scalable dimension as a result of a scaling activity. If
        the adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` , the scaling policy changes the scalable
        dimension of the scalable target by this amount.

        For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS
        service by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the service has
        4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you
        specified a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service
        by 2 tasks.

      - **Cooldown** *(integer) --*

        The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes where previous
        trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events.

        For scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been
        added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of
        the desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not
        excessively) scale out. For example, an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to scale out an
        Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown
        period of 5 minutes starts. During the cooldown period, if the alarm triggers the same
        policy again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the service by 3 tasks,
        the 2 tasks that were added in the previous scale-out event are considered part of that
        capacity and only 1 additional task is added to the desired count.

        For scale-in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests
        until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your
        application's availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during the
        cooldown period after a scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target
        immediately.

      - **MetricAggregationType** *(string) --*

        The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are ``Minimum`` , ``Maximum``
        , and ``Average`` . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as ``Average`` .

    - **TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A target tracking scaling policy.

      - **TargetValue** *(float) --*

        The target value for the metric. The range is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or
        2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

      - **PredefinedMetricSpecification** *(dict) --*

        A predefined metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a customized metric.

        - **PredefinedMetricType** *(string) --*

          The metric type. The ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` metric type applies only to Spot Fleet
          requests and ECS services.

        - **ResourceLabel** *(string) --*

          Identifies the resource associated with the metric type. You can't specify a resource
          label unless the metric type is ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` and there is a target group
          attached to the Spot Fleet request or ECS service.

          The format is
          app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>/targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>,
          where:

          * app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id> is the final portion of the load balancer
          ARN

          * targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id> is the final portion of the target
          group ARN.

            Describes the dimension names and values associated with a metric.

            - **Name** *(string) --*

        - **Statistic** *(string) --*

          The statistic of the metric.

        - **Unit** *(string) --*

          The unit of the metric.

      - **ScaleOutCooldown** *(integer) --*

        The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-out activity completes before another
        scale-out activity can start.

        While the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous
        scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity
        for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out.

      - **ScaleInCooldown** *(integer) --*

        The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes before another scale in
        activity can start.

        The cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until it has expired. The
        intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability. However,
        if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during the cooldown period after a scale-in,
        Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

      - **DisableScaleIn** *(boolean) --*

        Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking scaling policy is disabled. If the value
        is ``true`` , scale in is disabled and the target tracking scaling policy won't remove
        capacity from the scalable resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target tracking
        scaling policy can remove capacity from the scalable resource. The default value is
        ``false`` .

              - **ScalingAdjustment** *(integer) --*

                The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive

          - **MinAdjustmentMagnitude** *(integer) --*

            The minimum number to adjust your scalable dimension as a result of a scaling activity.
            If the adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` , the scaling policy changes the
            scalable dimension of the scalable target by this amount.

            For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS
            service by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the service
            has 4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because
            you specified a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the
            service by 2 tasks.

          - **Cooldown** *(integer) --*

            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes where previous
            trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events.

            For scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has
            been added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as
            part of the desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously

            scale out an Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully,
            and a cooldown period of 5 minutes starts. During the cooldown period, if the alarm
            triggers the same policy again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the
            service by 3 tasks, the 2 tasks that were added in the previous scale-out event are
            considered part of that capacity and only 1 additional task is added to the desired
            count.

            For scale-in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests
            until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your
            application's availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during

            or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

          - **PredefinedMetricSpecification** *(dict) --*

            A predefined metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a customized metric.

            - **PredefinedMetricType** *(string) --*

              The metric type. The ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` metric type applies only to Spot
              Fleet requests and ECS services.

            - **ResourceLabel** *(string) --*

              Identifies the resource associated with the metric type. You can't specify a resource
              label unless the metric type is ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` and there is a target
              group attached to the Spot Fleet request or ECS service.

              The format is
              app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>/targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>,
              where:

              * app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id> is the final portion of the load
              balancer ARN

              * targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id> is the final portion of the target
              group ARN.

          - **CustomizedMetricSpecification** *(dict) --*

            A customized metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a customized metric.

              The name of the metric.

            - **Namespace** *(string) --*

              The namespace of the metric.

            - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

              The dimensions of the metric.

              Conditional: If you published your metric with dimensions, you must specify the same
              dimensions in your scaling policy.

              - *(dict) --*

                Describes the dimension names and values associated with a metric.

                - **Name** *(string) --*

                  The name of the dimension.

                - **Value** *(string) --*

                  The value of the dimension.

            - **Statistic** *(string) --*

              The statistic of the metric.

            - **Unit** *(string) --*

              The unit of the metric.

          - **ScaleOutCooldown** *(integer) --*

            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-out activity completes before another
            scale-out activity can start.

            While the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been added by the previous
            scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the desired
            capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not excessively)
            scale out.

          - **ScaleInCooldown** *(integer) --*

            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes before another scale
            in activity can start.

            The cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until it has expired.
            The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability.
            However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during the cooldown period after a
            scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

          - **DisableScaleIn** *(boolean) --*

            Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking scaling policy is disabled. If the
            value is ``true`` , scale in is disabled and the target tracking scaling policy won't
            remove capacity from the scalable resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the
            target tracking scaling policy can remove capacity from the scalable resource. The
            default value is ``false`` .

        - **Alarms** *(list) --*

          The CloudWatch alarms associated with the scaling policy.

          - *(dict) --*

            Represents a CloudWatch alarm associated with a scaling policy.

    - **NextToken** *(string) --*

      The token required to get the next set of results. This value is ``null`` if there are no more
      results to return.

    Type definition for `ClientPutScalingPolicyStepScalingPolicyConfiguration` `StepAdjustments`

    Represents a step adjustment for a  StepScalingPolicyConfiguration . Describes an adjustment
    based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach
    threshold that you've defined for the alarm.

    For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

    * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60,
    specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

    * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50,
    specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

    There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

    * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

    * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative
    lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

    * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive
    upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

    * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

    - **MetricIntervalLowerBound** *(float) --*

      The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If

      be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it is exclusive
      (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null value indicates
      negative infinity.

    - **MetricIntervalUpperBound** *(float) --*

      The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If
      the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive (the metric must
      be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive (the metric must
      be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound). A null value indicates positive
      infinity.

      The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

    - **ScalingAdjustment** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

    Type definition for `ClientPutScalingPolicy` `StepScalingPolicyConfiguration`

    A step scaling policy.

    This parameter is required if you are creating a policy and the policy type is ``StepScaling`` .

    - **AdjustmentType** *(string) --*

      Specifies whether the ``ScalingAdjustment`` value in a  StepAdjustment is an absolute number
      or a percentage of the current capacity.

    - **StepAdjustments** *(list) --*

      A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach.

      - *(dict) --*

        Represents a step adjustment for a  StepScalingPolicyConfiguration . Describes an adjustment
        based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach
        threshold that you've defined for the alarm.

        For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

        * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60,
        specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

        * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50,
        specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

        There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

        * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

        * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a
        negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

        * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a
        positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

        * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

        - **MetricIntervalLowerBound** *(float) --*

          The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric.
          If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive (the
          metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it
          is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null
          value indicates negative infinity.

        - **MetricIntervalUpperBound** *(float) --*

          The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric.
          If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive (the
          metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive
          (the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound). A null
          value indicates positive infinity.

          The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

        - **ScalingAdjustment** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value
          adds to the current scalable dimension while a negative number removes from the current
          scalable dimension.

    - **MinAdjustmentMagnitude** *(integer) --*

      The minimum number to adjust your scalable dimension as a result of a scaling activity. If the
      adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` , the scaling policy changes the scalable
      dimension of the scalable target by this amount.

      For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service
      by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the service has 4 tasks
      and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a
      ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service by 2 tasks.

    - **Cooldown** *(integer) --*

      The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes where previous
      trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events.

      For scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been
      added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the
      desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not
      excessively) scale out. For example, an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to scale out an
      Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown
      period of 5 minutes starts. During the cooldown period, if the alarm triggers the same policy
      again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the service by 3 tasks, the 2
      tasks that were added in the previous scale-out event are considered part of that capacity and
      only 1 additional task is added to the desired count.

      For scale-in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until
      it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's
      availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during the cooldown period
      after a scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

    - **MetricAggregationType** *(string) --*

      The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are ``Minimum`` , ``Maximum`` ,
      and ``Average`` . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as ``Average`` .

    Represents a step adjustment for a  StepScalingPolicyConfiguration . Describes an adjustment
    based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach
    threshold that you've defined for the alarm.

    For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

    * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60,
    specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

    * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50,
    specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

    There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

    * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

    * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative
    lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

    * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive
    upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

      (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null value indicates
      negative infinity.

      Specifies whether the ``ScalingAdjustment`` value in a  StepAdjustment is an absolute number
      or a percentage of the current capacity.

    - **StepAdjustments** *(list) --*

      A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach.

      - *(dict) --*

        Represents a step adjustment for a  StepScalingPolicyConfiguration . Describes an adjustment
        based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach
        threshold that you've defined for the alarm.

        For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

        * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60,
        specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

        * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50,
        specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

        There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

        * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

        * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a
        negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

        * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a
        positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

        * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

        - **MetricIntervalLowerBound** *(float) --*

          The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric.
          If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive (the
          metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it
          is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null
          value indicates negative infinity.

          metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive
          (the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound). A null
          value indicates positive infinity.

          The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

          The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value
          adds to the current scalable dimension while a negative number removes from the current
          scalable dimension.

    - **MinAdjustmentMagnitude** *(integer) --*

      The minimum number to adjust your scalable dimension as a result of a scaling activity. If the
      adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` , the scaling policy changes the scalable
      dimension of the scalable target by this amount.

      For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service
      by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the service has 4 tasks
      and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a
      ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service by 2 tasks.

    - **Cooldown** *(integer) --*

      The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes where previous
      trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events.

      For scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been
      added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of the
      desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously (but not
      excessively) scale out. For example, an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to scale out an
      Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown
      period of 5 minutes starts. During the cooldown period, if the alarm triggers the same policy
      again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the service by 3 tasks, the 2
      tasks that were added in the previous scale-out event are considered part of that capacity and
      only 1 additional task is added to the desired count.

      For scale-in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests until
      it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's
      availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during the cooldown period
      after a scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

    - **MetricAggregationType** *(string) --*

      The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are ``Minimum`` , ``Maximum`` ,

          - **StepAdjustments** *(list) --*

            A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach.

            - *(dict) --*

              Represents a step adjustment for a  StepScalingPolicyConfiguration . Describes an
              adjustment based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch
              metric and the breach threshold that you've defined for the alarm.

              For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of
              50:

              * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less
              than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

              * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal
              to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

              There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

              * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

              * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has
              a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

              * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has
              a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

              * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

              - **MetricIntervalLowerBound** *(float) --*

                The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch
                metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is
                inclusive (the metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower
                bound). Otherwise, it is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold
                plus the lower bound). A null value indicates negative infinity.

              - **MetricIntervalUpperBound** *(float) --*

                The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch
                metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is
                exclusive (the metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound).
                Otherwise, it is inclusive (the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold
                plus the upper bound). A null value indicates positive infinity.

                The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

              - **ScalingAdjustment** *(integer) --*

                The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive
                value adds to the current scalable dimension while a negative number removes from
                the current scalable dimension.

          - **MinAdjustmentMagnitude** *(integer) --*

            The minimum number to adjust your scalable dimension as a result of a scaling activity.
            If the adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` , the scaling policy changes the
            scalable dimension of the scalable target by this amount.

            For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS
            service by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the service
            has 4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because
            you specified a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the
            service by 2 tasks.

          - **Cooldown** *(integer) --*

            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes where previous
            trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events.

            For scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has
            been added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the cooldown is calculated as
            part of the desired capacity for the next scale out. The intention is to continuously
            (but not excessively) scale out. For example, an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to
            scale out an Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully,
            and a cooldown period of 5 minutes starts. During the cooldown period, if the alarm
            triggers the same policy again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the
            service by 3 tasks, the 2 tasks that were added in the previous scale-out event are
            considered part of that capacity and only 1 additional task is added to the desired
            count.

            For scale-in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale-in requests
            until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your
            application's availability. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out policy during
            the cooldown period after a scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable
            target immediately.

          - **MetricAggregationType** *(string) --*

            The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. Valid values are ``Minimum`` ,
            ``Maximum`` , and ``Average`` . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as
            ``Average`` .

        - **TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration** *(dict) --*

          A target tracking scaling policy.

          - **TargetValue** *(float) --*

            The target value for the metric. The range is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10)
            or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

          - **PredefinedMetricSpecification** *(dict) --*

            A predefined metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a customized metric.

            - **PredefinedMetricType** *(string) --*

              label unless the metric type is ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` and there is a target
              group attached to the Spot Fleet request or ECS service.

              The format is
              app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>/targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>,

              balancer ARN
