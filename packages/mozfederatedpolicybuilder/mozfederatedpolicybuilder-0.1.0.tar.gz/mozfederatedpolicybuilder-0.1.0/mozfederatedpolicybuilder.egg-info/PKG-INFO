        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mozfederatedpolicybuilder.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/mozfederatedpolicybuilder) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mozilla-iam/mozfederatedpolicybuilder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mozilla-iam/mozfederatedpolicybuilder)
        
        The Mozilla federated policy builder helps craft AWS IAM Roles that permit users
        to assume those roles using a federated identity.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install mozfederatedpolicybuilder
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        mozfederatedpolicybuilder
        ```
        
        You'll be prompted to choose what type of output you want
        
        ```
        Policy format options :
        * c/cloudformation : A YAML CloudFormation template which provisions a
            federated IAM role
        * j/json-cloudformation : A JSON CloudFormation template which provisions a
            federated IAM role
        * a/awscli : An AWS CLI command line command which creates a federated IAM role
        * p/policy : The JSON trust relationship portion of the IAM policy (this can be
            copy pasted into the web console)
        
        What format would you like the policy returned in? (c/cloudformation / a/awscli / j/json)
        ```
        
        Select an output type. You'll be prompted for the groups you want to grant access
        
        ```
        User groups can be granted access to the federated IAM role.
        * Supported : Allow users in the group foo to assume the IAM role : "foo"
        * Supported : Allow users in the group foo as well as users in the group bar to
            assume the IAM role : "foo,bar"
        * Supported : Allow users in any group that begins with "foo_" : "foo_*"
        What groups would you like to grant access to this role?
        ```
        
        You'll next be prompted for the name of the AWS IAM Role
        
        ```
        What name would you like for the AWS IAM Role?
        ```
        
        Finally the tool will return the policy details in the format you've requested
