Description: # b3futurecontracts
        
        B3 is a stock exchange in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This module evaluates the rollover date of some of its future contracts.
        
        ## Classes
        
        Currently this module provides two classes, `B3FutureIndex` and `B3FutureDollar`. The classes have two main methods, `rollover_date` and `current_name`; both take a date as argument and return the rollover date and the current name of the future contract as of the given date, respectively.
        
        ## Sample code
        
        ```python
        import datetime as dt
        from b3futurecontracts import *
        
        today = dt.date.today()
        print(today)
        
        futureindex = B3FutureIndex(today)
        print(futureindex.rollover_date(), futureindex.current_name()[0])
        ```
