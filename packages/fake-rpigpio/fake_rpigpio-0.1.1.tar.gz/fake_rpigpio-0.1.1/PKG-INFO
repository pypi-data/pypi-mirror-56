Description: # fake-rpigpio
        
        `fake-rpigpio` is a package intended to provide a lightweight (dependency-free) fake
        interface for Raspberry Pi GPIO. The GPIO functions match those in the [`RPi.GPIO`](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/)
        library, however the functions do nothing. This makes it easier to test GPIO-related code
        and to get the code to run on non-pi machines.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package can be installed via pip:
        
        ```
        pip install fake-rpigpio
        ``` 
        
        ## Usage
        
        A basic example of using this package to run with `RPi.GPIO` on a Pi and `fake-rpigpio` on
        a non-Pi:
        
        ```python
        try:
            import RPi.GPIO
        except (RuntimeError, ModuleNotFoundError):
            import fake_rpigpio.utils
            fake_rpigpio.utils.install()
        ```
        
        This will install `fake-rpigpio.RPi` as `RPi` and `fake-rpigpio.RPi.GPIO` as `RPi.GPIO`,
        so you should not need to change imports for the `RPi.GPIO` library.
