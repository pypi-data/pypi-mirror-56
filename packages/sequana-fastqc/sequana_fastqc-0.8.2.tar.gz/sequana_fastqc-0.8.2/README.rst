This is is the **fastqc** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ projet

:Overview: Runs fastqc and multiqc on a set of Sequencing data to produce control quality reports
:Input: A set of FastQ files (paired or single-end) compressed or not
:Output: an HTML file index.html (multiqc) and tree.html (individual fastqc report)
:Status: production

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must install Sequana first::

    pip install sequana

Then, just install this package::

    pip install sequana_fastqc

Usage
~~~~~

::

    sequana_pipelines_fastqc --help
    sequana_pipelines_fastqc --input-directory DATAPATH --run-mode local
    sequana_pipelines_fastqc --input-directory DATAPATH --run-mode slurm

This creates a directory **fastq**. You just need to execute the pipeline::

    cd fastqc
    sh fastqc.sh  # for a local run

This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can retrieve the fastqc.rules and config.yaml files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::

    snakemake -s fastqc.rules --cores 4 --stats stats.txt

Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.
