#Savory Pie

Savory Pie is an API building library, we give you the pieces to build the API
you need. Currently Django is the main target, but the only dependencies on
Django are a single view and Resources and Fields that understand Django's ORM.

Installing
----
Note: it's recommended that you use `ujson` over the built in `json` library due to increased performance however if `ujson` is used when developing and testing this library, the tests will no longer pass due to material changes in JSON formatting.
