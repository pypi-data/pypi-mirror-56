Description: # Phoenics
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/FlorianHase/phoenics.svg?token=rULvnKYmWdFF3JqQBVVW&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/FlorianHase/phoenics)
        
        Phoenics is an open source optimization algorithm combining ideas from Bayesian optimization with Bayesian Kernel Density estimation [1]. It performs global optimization on expensive to evaluate objectives, such as physical experiments or demanding computations.

        # Using Phoenics
        
        Phoenics is designed to suggest new parameter points based on prior observations. The suggested parameters can then be passed on to objective evaluations (experiments or involved computation). As soon as the objective values have been determined for a set of parameters, these new observations can again be passed on to Phoenics to request new, more informative parameters.
        
        ```python
        from phoenics import Phoenics
            
        # create an instance from a configuration file
        config_file = 'config.json'
        phoenics    = Phoenics(config_file)
            
        # request new parameters from a set of observations
        params      = phoenics.recommend(observations = observations)
        ```
        Detailed examples for specific applications are presented in the `examples` folder.
