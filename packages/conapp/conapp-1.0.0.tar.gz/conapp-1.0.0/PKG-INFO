Description: # conapp - The easy config applier
        
        A simple project for applying config files from repos/tar files
        
        #### Example command:
        ```
        conapp config -u drew887 -b
        ```
        
        The above will:
          * download a tarball from drew887's config repo on bitbucket *(-b)*
          * take a backup of all the files that are listed in the tarball that
          would be overridden locally on your system. 
          * untar the repo into your home directory.
        
        ### Available commands:
        
        #### `config` Command
        Used for downloading and applying configs from either Bitbucket or Github.
        
          * `list`: Lists out configs that are available locally
          * `apply`: Download and apply a config based on username & repo name
          * `undo`: Remove files added by this config and apply last backup taken during
          its last application
        
              IE: `conapp config undo -u drew887` will:
               * delete all files listed in the currently downloaded config
               * apply the backup snapshot taken when the `drew887/config` repo was last applied
        
        
        #### `snapshots` Command
        Used for managing local backups created by conapp during the `config` commands
        
        Available sub commands:
          * `list`: List available backups
          * `apply`: Restore a backup
          * `delete`: Delete a backup
        
        #### `local` Command
        Used to checkout a bare repo and print out a shell (bash for now sorry!) alias to simplify the use of the repo.
        See https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles for more details on how this can be used.
        
        The basic idea is that it can be used to check out a config but have it be managed by git without clobbering your home 
        folder with a `.git` folder.
        
        Available sub commands:
          * `checkout` Checkout a bare repo into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/conapp/local/repo`
          * `alias` prints out an alias to make using the bare repo easier  
        
        ##### Example usage:
        ```shell script
        #check out the repo
        conapp local checkout -b -u drew887
        #setup the alias
        conapp local info >> ~/.bashrc
        #Now you can manage the repo with regular git commands aliased by default to `config`
        config status
        #regular git output here
        ```
        Note that you'll probably want to run `checkout`
