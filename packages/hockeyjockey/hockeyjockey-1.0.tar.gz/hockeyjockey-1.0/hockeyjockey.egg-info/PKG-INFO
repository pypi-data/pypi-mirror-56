Description: # hockeyjockey
        A menu-driven console-based application for analyzing NHL hockey matchups.
        
        ## Purpose
        This app was created to assist with making hockey pics for a so-called 'confidence pool' (such as this [NHL Pick 'Em Pool](https://www.officepooljunkie.com/info-nhl-hockey-pools.php)), where a pool participant must pick the outcome of several games and rank them in order of how confident they are that the chosen team in each matchup will win.
        
        ## Requirements:
         - Python 3.6+
         - decorest
         - ansicolors
        
        
        ## Installation:
        ```bash
        pip install hockeyjockey
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        from hockeyjockey import Jockey
        
        jockey = Jockey()
        jockey.menu_main.display_menu()
        ```
        Or just run __main__.py
        
        ## Documentation
        When hockeyjockey first loads, you will be given the option to load NHL statistics and matchups which have been cached to disk. If the local cache does not exist, or you elect not to use cached data, new data will be fetched from the internet.  
        
        The default is to fetch hockey matchups for today's date.
        
        ### Matchups Menu
        1. Load Today's Matchups - Loads the NHL games that are taking place today into memory.
        2. Load Upcoming Friday/Saturday - If today is a Friday or Saturday, loads the current Friday/Saturday's games, otherwise loads next weekend's Friday/Saturday games.
        3. Load Custom Date Range - Prompts for a start and end date and loads the games between those dates inclusive.
        4. Print Matchups - Echoes the currently loaded matchups to the console.
        
        ### Teams Menu
        1. Print Teams - Prints a list of the NHL teams in alphabetical order.
        
        ### Stats Menu
        1. Reload Stats - Fetches a fresh copy of the latest NHL statistics for all teams and stores it in memory. The stats stored in memory are the basis for hockeyjockey's ranking analysis.
        2. Rank Matchups by Single Statistic - Requires that a set of NHL matchups and statistics have been loaded. This option provides the main purpose for hockeyjockey - ranking a set of NHL matchups by a single stat which is chosen from the stats provided. For example, if the user of the program chooses 'wins', hockey jockey will output a list of matchups with the team with the most wins in each matchup highlighted green. The amplitude difference between the team with the greater number of wins and the team with the lesser number of wins is the key on which the matchups are ranked.
        3. Print Stats - Echoes the currently loaded NHL statistics for all teams to the console.
