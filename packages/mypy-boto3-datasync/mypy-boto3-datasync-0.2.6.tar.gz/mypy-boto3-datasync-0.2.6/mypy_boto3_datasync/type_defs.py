    Type definition for `ClientCreateTask` `Options`

    The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of the task that

    metadata such as user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), file permissions, data integrity verification,
    and so on.

    For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the
    ``OverrideOptions`` before starting a the task execution. For more information, see the operation.

    - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of
      a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

      Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

      POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

      ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

      NONE: Skip verification.

    - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved
      when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source
      file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the
      destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those
      changes.

      Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed
      information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

    - **Atime** *(string) --*

      A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was
      read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the
      original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING
      phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync
      can only do this on a best-effort basis.

      Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

      BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

      .. note::

        If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

        If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

    - **Mtime** *(string) --*

      A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to)
      before the PREPARING phase.

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

      NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

      .. note::

        If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

        If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

    - **Uid** *(string) --*

      The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

      Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

      INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

    - **Gid** *(string) --*

      The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

      Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

      INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

    - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

      A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file
      system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes
      objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For
      detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

      REMOVE: Delete destination files that arenâ€™t present in the source.

    - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
      character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device name and
      metadata on the destination.

      .. note::

        AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and
        don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

      Default value: NONE.

      NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

      PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported
      for Amazon EFS.

    - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

      A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as
      reading, writing, or execution of the file.

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore permissions.

      .. note::

        AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

    - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

      A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync
      to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

    - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to
      ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

      If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in series. For
      more information see  queue-task-execution .

    operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and
    file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification,
    and so on.

    A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in

    task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to  StartTaskExecution .

    - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the
      end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

      Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

      POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

      ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

      NONE: Skip verification.

    - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved
      when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source
      file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the
      destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting
      those changes.

      Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For
      detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

    - **Atime** *(string) --*

      A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file
      was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve
      the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the
      PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so
      AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

      Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

      BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

      .. note::

        If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

        If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

    - **Mtime** *(string) --*

      A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written
      to) before the PREPARING phase.

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

      NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

      .. note::

        If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

        If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

    - **Uid** *(string) --*

      The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

      Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

      INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

    - **Gid** *(string) --*

      The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

      Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

      INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

    - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

      A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file
      system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes
      objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For
      detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

      REMOVE: Delete destination files that arenâ€™t present in the source.

    - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
      character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device name
      and metadata on the destination.

      .. note::

        AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal
        and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

      Default value: NONE.

      NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

      PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
      supported for Amazon EFS.

    - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

      A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such
      as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore permissions.

      .. note::

        AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

    - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

      A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
      DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

    - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set
      to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

      If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in series.

    Type definition for `ClientDescribeTaskExecution` `Response`

    DescribeTaskExecutionResponse

    - **TaskExecutionArn** *(string) --*

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution that was described. ``TaskExecutionArn``
      is hierarchical and includes ``TaskArn`` for the task that was executed.

      For example, a ``TaskExecution`` value with the ARN
      ``arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execution/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b``
      executed the task with the ARN
      ``arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2`` .

    - **Status** *(string) --*

      The status of the task execution.

      For detailed information about task execution statuses, see Understanding Task Statuses in
      the *AWS DataSync User Guide.*

    - **Options** *(dict) --*

      Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a  StartTaskExecution
      operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and
      file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification,
      and so on.

      A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in
      StartTaskExecution , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each
      task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to  StartTaskExecution .

      - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

        A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the
        end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

        Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

        POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

        ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

        NONE: Skip verification.

      - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

        A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved
        when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source
        file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the
        destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting
        those changes.

        Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For
        detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

      - **Atime** *(string) --*

        A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file
        was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve
        the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the
        PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so
        AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

        Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

        BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

        NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

        .. note::

          If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

          If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

      - **Mtime** *(string) --*

        A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written
        to) before the PREPARING phase.

        Default value: PRESERVE.

        PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

        NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

        .. note::

          If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

          If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

      - **Uid** *(string) --*

        The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

      - **Gid** *(string) --*

        The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

      - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

        A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file
        system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes
        objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For
        detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

        Default value: PRESERVE.

        PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

        REMOVE: Delete destination files that arenâ€™t present in the source.

      - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

        A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
        character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device name
        and metadata on the destination.

        .. note::

          AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal
          and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

        Default value: NONE.

        NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

        PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
        supported for Amazon EFS.

      - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

        A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such
        as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

        Default value: PRESERVE.

        PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

        NONE: Ignore permissions.

        .. note::

          AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

      - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

        A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
        DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

      - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

        A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set
        to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

        If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in series.
        For more information see  queue-task-execution .

    - **Excludes** *(list) --*

      A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should
      contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are
      delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

      - *(dict) --*

        Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring files
        from source to destination.

        - **FilterType** *(string) --*

          The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

        - **Value** *(string) --*

          A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns
          are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``

    - **Includes** *(list) --*

      A list of filter rules that determines which files to include when running a task. The list
      should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to include. The patterns
      are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

      - *(dict) --*

        Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring files
        from source to destination.

        - **FilterType** *(string) --*

          The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

        - **Value** *(string) --*

          A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns
          are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``

    - **StartTime** *(datetime) --*

      The time that the task execution was started.

    - **EstimatedFilesToTransfer** *(integer) --*

      The expected number of files that is to be transferred over the network. This value is
      calculated during the PREPARING phase, before the TRANSFERRING phase. This value is the
      expected number of files to be transferred. It's calculated based on comparing the content of
      the source and destination locations and finding the delta that needs to be transferred.

    - **EstimatedBytesToTransfer** *(integer) --*

      The estimated physical number of bytes that is to be transferred over the network.

    - **FilesTransferred** *(integer) --*

      The actual number of files that was transferred over the network. This value is calculated
      and updated on an ongoing basis during the TRANSFERRING phase. It's updated periodically when
      each file is read from the source and sent over the network.

      If failures occur during a transfer, this value can be less than ``EstimatedFilesToTransfer``
      . This value can also be greater than ``EstimatedFilesTransferred`` in some cases. This
      element is implementation-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an indicator
      for a correct file number or to monitor your task execution.

    - **BytesWritten** *(integer) --*

      The number of logical bytes written to the destination AWS storage resource.

    - **BytesTransferred** *(integer) --*

        Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

        INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

        NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

      - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

        A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file
        system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes
        objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For
        detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

        Default value: PRESERVE.

        PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

        REMOVE: Delete destination files that arenâ€™t present in the source.

      - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

        A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
        character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device name
        and metadata on the destination.

        .. note::

          AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal
          and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

        Default value: NONE.

        NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

        PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
        supported for Amazon EFS.

      - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

        A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such
        as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

        Default value: PRESERVE.

        PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

        NONE: Ignore permissions.

        .. note::

          AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

      - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

        A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
        DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

      - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

        A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set
        to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

        If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in series.
        For more information see  queue-task-execution .

    - **Excludes** *(list) --*

      A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should
      contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are
      delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

      - *(dict) --*

        Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring files
        from source to destination.

        - **FilterType** *(string) --*

          The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

        - **Value** *(string) --*

          A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns

      The schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination location.

      - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --*

        A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer from a
        source to a destination location.

    - **ErrorCode** *(string) --*

      Errors that AWS DataSync encountered during execution of the task. You can use this error
      code to help troubleshoot issues.

    - **ErrorDetail** *(string) --*

    A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in

      A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was

      original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING

class ClientUpdateTaskOptionsTypeDef(_ClientUpdateTaskOptionsTypeDef):
    """
    Type definition for `ClientUpdateTask` `Options`

    Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a  StartTaskExecution
    operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file
    permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity verification, and so
    on.

    A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in
    StartTaskExecution , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on each
    task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to  StartTaskExecution .

    - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of
      a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

      Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

      POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

      ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

      NONE: Skip verification.

    - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or preserved
      when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be replaced by a source
      file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If you modify files in the
      destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to protect against overwriting those
      changes.

      Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For detailed
      information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

    - **Atime** *(string) --*

      A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the file was
      read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to preserve the
      original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the PREPARING
      phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync
      can only do this on a best-effort basis.

      Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

      BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

      .. note::

        If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

        If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

    - **Mtime** *(string) --*

      A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was written to)
      before the PREPARING phase.

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

      NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

      .. note::

        If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

        If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

    - **Uid** *(string) --*

      The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

      Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

      INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

    - **Gid** *(string) --*

      The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

      Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

      INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

    - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

      A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file
      system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes
      objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For
      detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

      REMOVE: Delete destination files that arenâ€™t present in the source.

    - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
      character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device name and
      metadata on the destination.

      .. note::

        AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and
        don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

      Default value: NONE.

      NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

      PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported
      for Amazon EFS.

    - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

      A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as
      reading, writing, or execution of the file.

      Default value: PRESERVE.

      PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

      NONE: Ignore permissions.

      .. note::

        AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

    - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

      A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS DataSync
      to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

    - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

      A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to
      ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

      If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in series. For
      more information see  queue-task-execution .
