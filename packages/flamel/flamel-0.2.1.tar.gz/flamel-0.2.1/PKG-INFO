Description: # flamel - flip YAML to JSON, and/or JSON to YAML
        
        Just like Nicholas Flamel, who could simply grab a pile of lead and turn it in
        to gold when he needed gold, flamel will turn your pile of YAML in to JSON when
        you need JSON. It will also turn your JSON in to YAML if that's what you want
        it to do.
        
        A few features:
        
        * Tries to detect input and flip to the alternative
        * Maintains the order of keys in mappings from input to output
        
        ## Install
        
        Flamel is available in the cheese shop: [https://pypi.org/project/flamel/](https://pypi.org/project/flamel/)
        
        You can install it with `pip install flamel`
        
        ## See it in action
        
        ```
        $ cat foo.yaml
        things:
          - thing1
          - thing2
        other:
          mapping: 9999
        $ flamel foo.yaml
        {
          "things": [
            "thing1",
            "thing2"
          ],
          "other": {
            "mapping": 9999
          }
        }
        $ flamel foo.yaml > foo.json
        $ flamel foo.json
        things:
        - thing1
        - thing2
        other:
          mapping: 9999
        ```
