Account Reversal
================

This module adds an action "Reversal" on account moves,
to allow the accountant to create reversal account moves in 2 clicks.
Also add on account entries:

* a checkbox and filter "to be reversed"
* a link between an entry and its reversal entry

Odoo v11c include a similar action (overwritten by this addon), but with less
features, for instance:

* Allowing inheritance
* Options like prefix (for journal entry and journal item), post and reconcile.
* Create a link between the entry and its reversal
* Mark entries to be reversed in the future.

Usage
=====

If you select an entry from Invoicing > Adviser > Accounting Entries > Journal Entries,
then an action menu 'Reverse Entries' is available. If clicked, then a wizard
allows user to select Reversal Date, Reversal Journal, Prefix, Post and Reconcile.

* If no Reversal Journal is selected, then the same journal is used
* If Post is True, then reversal entry will be posted else it will be leaved
  as a draft entry.
* If Post and Reconcile are True, then all entry lines with reconciled accounts
  of the entry will be reconciled with the reserval entry ones.

There is also a new menu Invoicing > Adviser > Accounting Entries > Journal Entries to be Reversed
in order to allow tracking entries that must be reserved for any reason.
