# Markdown to Notion-py

A renderer and uploader for Markdown files to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) using [`notion-py`](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py)

## Why use this package?

As of writing, Notion's Markdown importer has some problems:

* Code fences don't seem to retain their original language or format properly
* Inline HTML is removed, including iframes
* Markdown frontmatter is removed
* Local image references show up as blank images
* Image alts are loaded as `TextBlock`s instead of captions
* Among others...

This package aims to make bulk import much easier by solving the problems above. If you dislike the way this package implements a specific Markdown to Notion conversion or you need extra functionality (like uploading your images to Cloud hosting), you can always subclass [`NotionPyRenderer`](https://github.com/Cobertos/md2notion/blob/master/md2notion/NotionPyRenderer) (a [`BaseRenderer` for `mistletoe`](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe)) and change it or hook its behavior.

## Limitations

* Currently does not support tables/`CollectionViewBlocks`

## Usage with Python 3.6+

* `pip install md2notion`

* From the command link you can run `python -m md2notion.convert [token_v2] [page-url] [...markdown_path_globs]`

* OR In your Python file:
```python
from notion.client import NotionClient
from md2notion.convert import convert

# Follow the instructions at https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py#quickstart to setup Notion.py
client = NotionClient(token_v2="<token_v2>")
page = client.get_block("https://www.notion.so/myorg/Test-c0d20a71c0944985ae96e661ccc99821")

with open("TestMarkdown.md", "r") as f:
    convert(f, page)
```
