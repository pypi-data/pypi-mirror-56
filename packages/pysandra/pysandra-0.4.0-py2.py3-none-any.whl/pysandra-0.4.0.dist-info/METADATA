## Progress

In case you didn't read the notice, there's quite a limited set of functionality at the moment.

Things that exist:

* asyncio interface
* basic query support (with results into native python types)
* basic DML support
* basic DDL query
* basic prepared statements
* basic TLS support
* ...
* see protocol.md for more details

Things that don't exist:

* any authentication support
* sync support (version 2.0)
* paging, batch support
* stable api
* friendly api
* connection to more then one cluster member
* ...
* why are you still reading this.


## Goals

* cassandra client driver for asyncio based applications
* allow doing anything the wire protocol allows and servers tolerate

## Implementation

Currently targeting python 3.6 and above

Aims to be:

* correct
* fast
* efficient
* developer friendly

## Todos

* tls context
* paging
* AUTH
* Tests
* api docs
* make user objects user friendly (exceptions, EventChange, Rows)
* batch
* client connection routing
* cqlshell
