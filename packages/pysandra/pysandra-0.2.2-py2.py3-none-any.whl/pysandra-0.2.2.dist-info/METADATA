## NOTICE

This project has just started.

In order to get the SDLC complete, this project is published on github and pypi.

This is only recommened for people who want

* to get involved in development,
* give feedback
* are happy with it's very limited state

Please check back often, I hope to get this to a generally useful state this year.

Contributions, advice welcome, development coodinated on github

## Progress

In case you didn't read the notice, there's quite a limited set of funcationity at the moment.

Things that exist:

* asyncio interface
* basic DML query (all results are just bytes at the moment)
* basic prepared statements

Things that don't exist:
* any authnetication support
* any ssl support
* any connection support other then localhost :)
* sync support (version 2.0)
* DDL support
* full error handling
* results into native python types
* ...
* why are you still reading this.


## Goals

* cassandra client driver for asyncio based applications
* allow doing anything the wire protocol allows

## Implementation

Currently targeting python 3.6 and above

Aims to be:

* correct
* fast
* efficient
* developer friendly

## Todos

* Tests
* TLS
* AUTH
* typing

## Developing

$ cd pysandra
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
