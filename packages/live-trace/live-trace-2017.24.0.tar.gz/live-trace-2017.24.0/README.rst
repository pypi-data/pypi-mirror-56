live-trace
==========

live-trace is a Python library to log stacktraces of a running application in a
daemon thread N times per second.  The log file can be analyzed to see
where the interpreter spends most of the time.  It is called
"live-trace" since it can be used on production systems without
noticeable performance impact.

Alternatives
============

Please, do not use live-trace any more. I recommend this:

[py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) and [speedscope](https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope) for analyzing the profile graph.


Why live trace?
===============

If you want to see why a particular request is slow, then use a profiler, not live-trace.

Use live-trace if you want to see the bird's-eye view. If you ask yourself the question:

  What is the interpreter doing all day long?

Then use live-trace in your production environment. Let it collect a lot of snaphosts of the interpreter state.
The current implementation uses stacktraces for freezing the state of the interpreter. 
After running for some hours you can aggregate the collected stacktraces
and identify hot spots.


Usage
=====

Usage run-and-analyze::

    you@unix> live-trace run-and-analyze your-python-script.py

Usage run, analyze later::

    you@unix> live-trace run your-python-script.py

    The collected stacktraces will be written to $TMP/live_trace/YYYY-MM-DD....log

    Now you can analyze the collected stacktraces:

    you@unix> live-trace analyze tmp/live_trace/2017-01-09-11-23-40.log

Development
===========

# Installing for development
pip install -e git+https://github.com/guettli/live-trace.git#egg=live-trace

# Running tests
cd src/live-trace
python setup.py test

Django Middleware
=================

The django middleware is optional. The tool live-trace is a general python tool.
If you want to use live-trace in other web frameworks, take this as template.

You can start the watching thread your django middleware like this::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[
        ...
        'live_trace.django_middleware.LiveTraceMiddleware',
    ]

Optional, update the `settings.py`::

    live_trace_interval=0.1 # Default is every 0.3 second. Set to None to disable live-tracing.

Example
=======

The tool does some guessing which code is from you, and which code is from Python or Django.

Since Python and Django code is already optimized, your code gets highlighted with "<====".

That's most likely your code and this could be a bottle neck::
