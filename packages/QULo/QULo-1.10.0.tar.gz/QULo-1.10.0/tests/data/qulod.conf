#  Important feature: upon start, it is checked that the host variable
# is really the same as the real hostname. Else it does not start.
# This feature is to prevent accidental starts of qulod on slave nodes.
# (Slave instances should only be started from the master node.) If
# it is needed to run a master instance, then the user must modify the
# configuration script accordingly.
