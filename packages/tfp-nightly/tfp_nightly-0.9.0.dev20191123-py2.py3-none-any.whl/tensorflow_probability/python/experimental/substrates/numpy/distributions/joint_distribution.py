class JointDistribution(distribution_lib.Distribution):
  """Joint distribution over one or more component distributions.

  This distribution enables both sampling and joint probability computation from
  a single model specification.

  A joint distribution is a collection of possibly interdependent distributions.

  **Note**: unlike other non-`JointDistribution` distributions in
  `tfp.distributions`, `JointDistribution.sample` (and subclasses) return a
  structure of  `Tensor`s rather than a `Tensor`.  A structure can be a `list`,
  `tuple`, `dict`, `collections.namedtuple`, etc. Accordingly
  `joint.batch_shape` returns a structure of `TensorShape`s for each of the
  distributions' batch shapes and `joint.batch_shape_tensor()` returns a
  structure of `Tensor`s for each of the distributions' event shapes. (Same with
  `event_shape` analogues.)

  #### Subclass Requirements

  Subclasses implement:

  - `_flat_sample_distributions`: returns two `list`-likes: the first being a
    sequence of `Distribution`-like instances the second being a sequence of
    `Tensor` samples, each one drawn from its corresponding `Distribution`-like
    instance. The optional `value` argument is either `None` or a `list`-like
    with the same `len` as either of the results.

  - `_model_flatten`: takes a structured input and returns a sequence.

  - `_model_unflatten`: takes a sequence and returns a structure matching the
    semantics of the `JointDistribution` subclass.

  Subclasses initialize:

  - `_single_sample_distributions`: an iterable sequence of distributions
    which are known at `__init__` or `None`.
