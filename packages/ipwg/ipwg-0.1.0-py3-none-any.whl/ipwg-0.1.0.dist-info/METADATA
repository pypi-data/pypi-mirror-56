passwords of any length and with required types
of characters.

A commandline tool is also available for all your
commandline task needs.

## Quick Start

pip install ipwg
```

For commandline use, you are all set. just run:

```bash
# 10 is the number of characters.
ipwg 10

For use in your own code:

```python
from ipwg import Generator

# You can customize your charsets globally
Generator.specials = '!@#$'

generator = Generator(enable_all=True)
generator.specials_count = 1

# generate a 10 character long password with
# at least 1 of !@#$
pwd = generator.create_password(10)
```
