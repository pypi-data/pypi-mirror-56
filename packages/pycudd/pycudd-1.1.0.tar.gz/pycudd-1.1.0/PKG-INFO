        # PyCUDD
        
        PyCUDD is a selection of bindings for the CUDD BDD manipulation library.
        
        Currently, it allows Python users to access a significant amount of the
        Colorado Decision Diagram (CUDD) package in a simplified object oriented
        manner. PyCUDD hides many of the details associated with using CUDD such as
        garbage collection and manager references. 
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        * cudd 3.0.0+ (included in the package)
        * swig (PyCUDD has been tested with version 3.0.10 on Ubuntu 14.04)
        
        For Ubuntu or Linux Mint, swig is available via apt:
        
            apt-get install swig
        
        For OS X, swig is available via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

        ### Installation
