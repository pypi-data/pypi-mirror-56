Description: # Integration: PyCOMPSs and HDFS
        
        The abstraction that is provided by this version is exactly the same as
         that provided by the version in java. Please read the Java version 
         before continuing.
        
        # How to install the HDFSPyCOMPSs module
        
        This module is available at PyPi, 
        
        ```bash
            $ pip3 install hdfspycompss
        ```
        
        After install it, you need set up some environment variables:
        
         * HADOOP_HOME: the root of your installed Hadoop distribution. Often has lib/native/libhdfs.so.
         * JAVA_HOME: the location of your Java SDK installation.
         * CLASSPATH: must contain the Hadoop jars
         
        ```bash
        export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:`$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs classpath --glob`
        ```
        
        Because COMPSs don't copy all environment variables to all workers, it's important to set these variables at /etc/environment.
        
        
        # Example of how to use the API (without StorageAPI)
        
        ```python
        def wordcount(blk, word):
            from hdfspycompss.block import Block
            data = Block(blk).read_block()
            ...
            return result
        
        def main():
            import hdfspycompss.hdfs import HDFS
            dfs = HDFS(host='localhost', port=9000)
            HDFS_BLOCKS = dfs.find_blocks('/input.data')
        
            nFrag = len(HDFS_BLOCKS)
            result = [{} for f in range(nFrag)]
            for f, blk in enumerate(HDFS_BLOCKS):
                result[f] = wordcount(blk, 'word')
            ...
        ```
