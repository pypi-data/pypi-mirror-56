Description: Python Driver for Oracle NoSQL Database
        ===========================================
        
        A Python driver for Oracle NoSQL Database.  This driver requires at least
        version 4.2.x of Oracle NoSQL Database and makes use of a (bundled) Java
        proxy server to communicate with the database.  Communication with the
        proxy is done using a Thrift-based protocol.
        
        This driver supports Python 2.7.
