Description: # Myelin
        
        A library to do deep learning with spiking neural networks. 
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        The primary dependencies of this project are torch, tensorflow and OpenAI gym.
        A more comprehensive list of dependencies can be found in ```myelin.yml```.
        
        ## Examples
        
        The directory [myelin/task](myelin/task) contains three example experiments.
        You can execute them by invoking the run_*.py scripts from this directory.
        
        - To train a MNIST classification network, invoke
            ```
            python run_mnist.py
            ```
        - To train a CIFAR classification network, invoke
            ```
            python run_cifar.py
            ```
        - To train the cartpole balancing task with Policy gradient, invoke
            ```
            python run_gym.py
            ```
        The default choices of hyperparameters are meant as reasonable starting points,
        they can be improved upon.
