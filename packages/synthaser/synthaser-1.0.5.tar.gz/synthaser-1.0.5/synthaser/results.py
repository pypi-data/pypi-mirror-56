"""
This module stores functions for parsing CD-Search output.

It provides a single public function, `parse`, which takes an open file handle
corresponding to a CD-Search hit table and returns a list of fully characterized
Synthase objects, i.e.:

>>> from synthaser import results
>>> with open('results.txt') as handle:
...     synthases = results.parse(handle)
>>> synthases
[AN6791.2 KS-AT-DH-MT-ER-KR-ACP, ... ]

Domain associations are specified in the `DOMAINS` dictionary, which maps entries in
NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD) to broader megasynthase domain categories.
For example:

>>> results.DOMAINS['KS']
['PKS_KS', 'PKS', 'FabB', 'CLF', ... ]

The functions in this module are agnostic to the contents of this dictionary. Thus,
existing domain types can be extended with new CDD entries, or new domain types can be
created, just by adding to this dictionary.

When doing this, you must add corresponding entries to `CD_LENGTHS` and
`BITSCORE_THRESHOLDS`, which store the lengths of each CD, and the bitscore threshold
used by CD-Search to register the CD as a specific hit, respectively.

For example, to add the carnitine O-acyltransferase (cAT) domain, recently characterized
in an HR-PKS system (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201705237), we perform the following three steps:

>>> results.DOMAINS['cAT'] = ['Carn_acyltransf']
>>> results.CD_LENGTHS['Carn_acyltransf'] = 575
>>> results.BITSCORE_THRESHOLDS['Carn_acyltransf'] = 255.925

Future searches in this environment will then report any instances of this domain.
Currently, a fairly extensive list of fungal PKS domains is hard-coded into this
dictionary. Suggestions for more are welcomed via GitHub issues or pull requests.

Finally, rules can be created for filtering of adjacent domains in the `ADJACENCY_RULES`
dictionary. These rules take the form of lambda functions that accept two Domain objects
as input and return True/False. This is useful since the CDD does not always have exact
CDs that match certain synthase domain types. For example, NRPS epimerization (E)
domains are always detected as condensation (C) domains. However, every NRPS containing
an E domain (in my observations) also report hits for the NRPS-para261 domain family
either within (near the end), or immediately after, the C domain hit. Thus, I created an
adjacency rule to specifically check for this:

>>> results.ADJACENCY_RULES['E'] = lambda a, b: len(a) > len(b) and a.type == "C" and b.type == "E"

Here I define a lambda function which will take two Domain objects and return True if
1) they are C and E domains, and 2) the C is bigger than the E.
This is checked within both overlapping Domain groups (i.e. look for containment) and
against the entire list of Domain objects in a Synthase.
