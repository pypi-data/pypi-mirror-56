        # What is BrainFuck?
        brainfuck is an esoteric programming language with only 8 oparetions
        
        |operation  | Explanation|
        |- | -|
        |`>` |  increment the data pointer.|
        |`<` | decrement the data pointer.|
        |`+` | increment the byte at the data pointer.|
        |`-`  | decrement the byte at the data pointer.|
        |`.` | output the byte at the data pointer.|
        |`,` | accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.|
        |`[` |if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching `]` command.|
        |`]` |if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching `[` command.|
