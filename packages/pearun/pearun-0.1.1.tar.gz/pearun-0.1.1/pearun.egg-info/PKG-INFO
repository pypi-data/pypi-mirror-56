Description: # Pearun
        
        A simple utility to run user defined commands.
        
        Inspired by scripts in package.json of npm based projects.
        
        ## Install package
        
        `pip install pearun`
        
        ## Usage
        
        User commands are parsed from Pearunfile which contains simple json dictionary.
        
        It is possible to run inline shell commands or execute whole script files.
        
        With your Pearunfile ready, you can list your commands by: 
        
        `pearun` or `pearun --help`
        
        Or with `-f/--file` argument when your Pearunfile is not in your CWD:
        
        `pearun -f <path_to_Pearunfile>` or `pearun --file <path_to_Pearunfile>`
        
        To execute your command, simply type its name as an argument:
        
        `pearun hello_world`
        
        
        ### Pearunfile example
        
        ```.json
        {
            "hello_world": "echo \"Hello World!\"",
            "script:default": "./script.sh",
            "script:with_arg": "./script.sh some_arg",
            "boolean": "echo \"TRUE/FALSE\"",
            "pyth": "python -c \"print(1 + 1)\""
        }
        ```
