# AntimonyCombinations
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CiaranWelsh/AntimonyCombinations.svg?branch=master)
![Coverage](coverage.svg)

`AntimonyCombinations` is a package developed on top of 
[tellurium](http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/) and 
[antimony](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/) for building 
[sbml](http://sbml.org/Main_Page) models in a combinatorial
way. 

The idea is that you have a core model which you 
are more confident in regarding its structure and an arbitrary
number of additional hypotheses, called hypothesis extensions.
`AntimonyCombinations` provides a way of quickly building the
comprehensive set of model topologies, given the core hypothesis
and hypothesis extensions.
