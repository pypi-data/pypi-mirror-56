`AntimonyCombinations` is a package developed on top of 
[tellurium](http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/) and 
[antimony](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/) for building 
[sbml](http://sbml.org/Main_Page) models in a combinatorial
way. 

The idea is that you have a core model which you 
are more confident in regarding its structure and an arbitrary
number of additional hypotheses, called hypothesis extensions.
`AntimonyCombinations` provides a way of quickly building the
comprehensive set of model topologies, given the core hypothesis
and hypothesis extensions. 

## Installation

`$ pip install AntimonyCombinations`
    
## Import

`>>> from antimony_combinations import Combinations, HypothesisExtension`

## Parameter estimations and model selection
The precursor to this package was designed for a comprehensive model selection problem which used `tellurium` and `antimony` for constructing `sbml` models, and `pycotools3` and `COPASI` for configuring and running parameter estimations. This can be, but is not currently supported. It is on the `todo` list. 

Since connecting with COPASI in this way isn't ideal it would also be advantageous to support a second backend that doesn't rely on COPASI. This is a work in progress.
