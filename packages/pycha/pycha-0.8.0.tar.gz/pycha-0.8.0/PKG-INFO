        =====
        
        Pycha is a very simple Python package for drawing charts using the great
        `Cairo <http://www.cairographics.org/>`_ library. Its goals are:
        
        * Lightweight
        * Simple to use
        * Nice looking with default values
        * Customization
        
        It won't try to draw any possible chart on earth but draw the most common ones
        nicely. There are some other options you may want to look at like
        `pyCairoChart <http://bettercom.de/de/pycairochart>`_.
        
        Pycha is based on `Plotr <http://solutoire.com/plotr/>`_ which is based on
        `PlotKit <http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/>`_. Both libraries are written in
        JavaScript and are great for client web programming. I needed the same for the
        server side so that's the reason I ported Plotr to Python. Now we can deliver
        charts to people with JavaScript disabled or embed them in PDF reports.
