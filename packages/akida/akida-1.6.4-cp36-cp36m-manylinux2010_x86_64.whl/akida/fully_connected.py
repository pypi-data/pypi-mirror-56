    This is used for most processing purposes, since any neuron in the layer
    can be connected to any input channel.

    Outputs are returned from FullyConnected layers as a list of events, that
    is, as a triplet of x, y and feature values. However, FullyConnected
    models by definition have no intrinsic spatial organization. Thus, all
    output events have x and y values of zero with only the f value being
    meaningful â€“ corresponding to the index of the event-generating neuron.
    Note that each neuron can only generate a single event for each packet of
    inputs processed.
