# Goal

Precompiled python wheels containing the clang-format and python support files.
Thus, one has pip installable clang-format useful for CI/CD, and local formatting
changes, with a stable output, as long as the same version is used.

The repository for building the wheels are available at:
https://github.com/mgevaert/clang-format-wheel/

# Versions

The idea is to track all officially released clang-format versions, as time permits.

# General Outline

1. LLVM and clang source is downloaded by host_actions.py; build scripts are created
2. Docker image from quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_x86_64 is started
3. In the container, using the build scripts created before:
    1. CMake is built (currently the cmake wheels don't work on manylinux1)
    2. Each of the desired clang-format binaries are statically built
    3. A python package skeleton is copied, and used by `bdist_wheel`
    4. `auditwheel repair` is used to make sure no library dependencies exist,
       and that the package is self-contained
4. Packages are uploaded via twine
