# Introduction
Tools available:

* entrez - streamlines BioPython
* citations - creates citations for 6 different types using IMS standards
* date - formats dates into our desired format
* sanitizer - mostly useful for forcing unicode compliance in python2

## Citations

Citations are based on a standard defined by PubMed https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/.
For some publication types, passing the italicize parameter with a True value will return
HTML with italic tagged journals or conference names.

## Journals

The journals module uses the PMC source file https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/?format=csv
to construct a library of journals keyed by abbreviation or full title.
