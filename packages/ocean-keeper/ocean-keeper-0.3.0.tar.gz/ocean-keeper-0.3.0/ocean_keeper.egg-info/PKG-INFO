Description: # ocean-keeper
        Wraps keeper contracts and web3 functions.
        
        ##### How to
        The main class is `Keeper` and all contracts are accessible directly from the `keeper` instance.
        Each deployed contract has a python wrapper class exposing the main functions and validating 
        inputs.
        
        ```python
        import os
        from ocean_keeper import Keeper
        from ocean_keeper.contract_handler import ContractHandler
        from ocean_keeper.web3_provider import Web3Provider
        from ocean_keeper.utils import get_account
        
        # Init the web3 instance
        Web3Provider.init_web3('http://localhost:8545')  # Assume running with local parity node
        # set the contract handler path to abi files
        ContractHandler.set_artifacts_path(os.path.expanduser('~/.ocean/keeper-contracts/artifacts'))
        # get keeper instance
        keeper = Keeper.get_instance(artifacts_path=ContractHandler.artifacts_path)
        # Do stuff with keeper and it's contracts
        account = get_account(0)
        keeper.did_registry.register('0x10101010101010101010', '', 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1/assets', account)
        
        ```
        
        Account can be specified using the following environment variables:
        * PARITY_ADDRESS: the ethereum address
        * PARITY_PASSWORD: the password to decrypt key in the `PARITY_ENCRYPTED_KEY`
        * PARITY_KEY: the private key of this account (matches the `PARITY_ADDRESS`)
        * PARITY_ENCRYPTED_KEY: the encrypted key in a json str
        * PARITY_KEYFILE: path to the json file that has the encrypted key specified in json document
        
        Note: The keys are loaded in this order: `PARITY_KEY`, `PARITY_ENCRYPTED_KEY`, `PARITY_KEYFILE`. If `PARITY_KEY` is 
        specified the password and other environment variables are ignored.
