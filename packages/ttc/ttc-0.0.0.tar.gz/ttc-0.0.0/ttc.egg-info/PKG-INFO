Description: # TremTec CLI
        
        As a TremTec Engineer, we need tools to make our daily work easier, because of that we've created the TremTec CLI, or just `ttc`. We intend to provider a lot of features like:
        
        - **WorkSpace Management**: Create separated environments for your packages `pip`, `node`, and other languages.
        - **Package Management**: Install, update and remove packages for your projects.
        - **GitLab Integration**: You can create Merge Requests, test ci files, list docker register images, and a lot more from the cli.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To install our cli tool, you need to:
        
        ```bash
        pip install ttc
        ```
        
        then you should configure you environment:
        
        ```bash
        ttc configure
        ```
        
        To see our command options, type
        
        ```bash
        ttc --help
        # or
        ttc -h
        ```
        
        ## Add autocompletion
        
        Just add to you `.bashrc` or `.zsh`:
        
        ```bash
        eval "$(_TTC_COMPLETE=source ttc)"
        eval "$(_TT_COMPLETE=source tt)"
        ```
        
        ### Dev mode
        
        To install as a developer, first clone the project, go to a the cloned folder and then:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e '.[dev]'
        ```
        
        ##
