* Can address multiple REST endpoints depending on extension(s)
* 1 REST endpoint is a associated to 1 extension in vCD
* Backend servers:
    * HTTP + HTTPS support
    * Basic authentication
    * Basic URI rewritting

Planned features
----------------

* #6 - Address some pre-checks like rights management
* #18 - Check organization's membership of an user
* #2 - Manage extension lifecycle (deploy/re-deploy)

User case
---------

In a vCloud Director instance where 2 API extensions are used (`example1`, `example2`):


**vcdextproxy** subscribe to following AMQP queues:

* `example1`
* `example2`

When a message is sent to `example1` queue:

1. A URI path check is made: is `/api/example1` a correct API path for extension named **example1** ?
2. If valid, all fields of the request are converted to REST request (as headers or as body content)
3. REST endpoint handle the request as a standard REST one (with a lot of vCloud information...)
4. REST endpoint replies to **vcdextproxy**
5. **vcdextproxy** reformat the reply as an AMQP reply message
