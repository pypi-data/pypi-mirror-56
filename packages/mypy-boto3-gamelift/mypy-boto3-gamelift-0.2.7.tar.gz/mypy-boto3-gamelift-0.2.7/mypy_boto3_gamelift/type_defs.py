      Unique identifier for an event resource, such as a fleet ID.

    - **EventCode** *(string) --*

      Type of event being logged. The following events are currently in use:

       **Fleet creation events:**

      * FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet record was successfully created with a status of ``NEW`` .
      Event messaging includes the fleet ID.

      * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from ``NEW`` to ``DOWNLOADING`` . The
      compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.

      * FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance.

      * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to
      an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved
      to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status.
      Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the
      instance. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

      * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully
      extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is
      included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs
      for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed
      successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

      * FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the
      Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in
      the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon
      GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready.
      Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this
      stage list the launch paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is
      found. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

      * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from ``DOWNLOADING`` to ``VALIDATING`` .

      * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time configuration
      failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.

      * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from ``VALIDATING`` to ``BUILDING`` .

      * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time configuration
      failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet
      instance.

      * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from ``BUILDING`` to ``ACTIVATING`` .

      * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in
      the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was
      successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to
      start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the game server is not
      reporting "process ready" to the Amazon GameLift service.

      * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ``ACTIVATING`` to ``ACTIVE`` . The
      fleet is now ready to host game sessions.

       **VPC peering events:**

      * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established between the
      VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account.

      * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details
      and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A
      common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of
      IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account.

      * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been successfully deleted.

       **Spot instance events:**

      * INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute
      notification.

       **Other fleet events:**

      * FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings (desired
      instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity
      settings.

      * FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was made to the fleet's
      game session protection policy setting. Event messaging includes both the old and new
      policy setting.

      * FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.

      * GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

    - **Message** *(string) --*

      Additional information related to the event.

    - **EventTime** *(datetime) --*

        configuration identifies several game features:

        * The destinations where a new game session can potentially be hosted. Amazon GameLift tries
        these destinations in an order based on either the queue's default order or player latency
        information, if provided in a placement request. With latency information, Amazon GameLift
        can place game sessions where the majority of players are reporting the lowest possible
        latency.

        * The length of time that placement requests can wait in the queue before timing out.

        * A set of optional latency policies that protect individual players from high latencies,
        preventing game sessions from being placed where any individual player is reporting latency
        higher than a policy's maximum.

        *  DescribeGameSessionQueues

        - **Name** *(string) --*

          Descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must be unique
          within each region.

        - **GameSessionQueueArn** *(string) --*

          Amazon Resource Name (`ARN
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is assigned
          to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is
          ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>:<aws account>:gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`` .

        - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --*

          Maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue.
          When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a ``TIMED_OUT``
          status.

        - **PlayerLatencyPolicies** *(list) --*

          Collection of latency policies to apply when processing game sessions placement requests
          with player latency information. Multiple policies are evaluated in order of the maximum
          latency value, starting with the lowest latency values. With just one policy, it is
          enforced at the start of the game session placement for the duration period. With multiple
          policies, each policy is enforced consecutively for its duration period. For example, a
          queue might enforce a 60-second policy followed by a 120-second policy, and then no policy
          for the remainder of the placement.

          - *(dict) --*

            Queue setting that determines the highest latency allowed for individual players when
            placing a game session. When a latency policy is in force, a game session cannot be
            placed at any destination in a region where a player is reporting latency higher than
            the cap. Latency policies are only enforced when the placement request contains player
            latency information.

              The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All
              policies must have a value set for this property.

            - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --*

              The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game
              session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the
              queue times out.

        - **Destinations** *(list) --*

          List of fleets that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue.
          Fleets are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN. Destinations are listed
          in default preference order.

          - *(dict) --*

            Fleet designated in a game session queue. Requests for new game sessions in the queue
            are fulfilled by starting a new game session on any destination configured for a queue.

      configuration. Queues can be located in any region.

      - *(string) --*

    - **RequestTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --*

      Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before
      timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.

    - **AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --*

      Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player
      rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for
      an acceptable match.

    - **AcceptanceRequired** *(boolean) --*

      Flag that determines whether a match that was created with this configuration must be
      accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.

    - **RuleSetName** *(string) --*

      Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking
      configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.

          Set of values, expressed in milliseconds, indicating the amount of latency that a
          player experiences when connected to AWS regions. If this property is present,
          FlexMatch considers placing the match only in regions for which latency is reported.

          If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency
          in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes

    * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to
    evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player
    attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might

    minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be
    evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.

        (status ``RESERVED`` ) or actual player activity in a game session (status ``ACTIVE`` ). A
        player session object (including player data) is automatically passed to a game session when
        the player connects to the game session and is validated.

        When a player disconnects, the player session status changes to ``COMPLETED`` . Once the
        session ends, the player session object is retained for 30 days and then removed.

      * FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet record was successfully created with a status of ``NEW`` .
      Event messaging includes the fleet ID.

      * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from ``NEW`` to ``DOWNLOADING`` . The
      compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.

      * FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance.

      * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to
      an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved
      to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status.
      Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the
      instance. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

      * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully
      extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is
      included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs
      for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed
      successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

      * FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the
      Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in
      the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon
      GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready.
      Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this
      stage list the launch paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is
      found. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

      * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from ``DOWNLOADING`` to ``VALIDATING`` .

      * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time configuration
      failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.

      * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from ``VALIDATING`` to ``BUILDING`` .

      * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time configuration
      failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet
      instance.

      * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from ``BUILDING`` to ``ACTIVATING`` .

      * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in
      the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was
      successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to
      start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the game server is not
      reporting "process ready" to the Amazon GameLift service.

      * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ``ACTIVATING`` to ``ACTIVE`` . The
      fleet is now ready to host game sessions.

       **VPC peering events:**

      * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established between the
      VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account.

      * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details
      and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A
      common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of
      IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account.

      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html>`__

      * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been successfully deleted.

       **Spot instance events:**

      * INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute
      notification.

          Type of event being logged. The following events are currently in use:

           **Fleet creation events:**

          * FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet record was successfully created with a status of ``NEW`` .
          Event messaging includes the fleet ID.

          * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from ``NEW`` to ``DOWNLOADING`` . The
          compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.

          * FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet instance.

          * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to
          an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved
          to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status.
          Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the
          instance. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

          * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully
          extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is
          included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs
          for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed
          successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

          * FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful, and the
          Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in
          the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon
          GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready.
          Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this
          stage list the launch paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is
          found. Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

          * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from ``DOWNLOADING`` to ``VALIDATING`` .

          * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time configuration
          failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.

          * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from ``VALIDATING`` to ``BUILDING`` .

          * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time configuration
          failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet
          instance.

          * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from ``BUILDING`` to ``ACTIVATING`` .

          * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in
          the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was
          successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to
          start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the game server is not
          reporting "process ready" to the Amazon GameLift service.

          * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ``ACTIVATING`` to ``ACTIVE`` . The
          fleet is now ready to host game sessions.

           **VPC peering events:**

          * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established between the
          VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account.

          * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details
          and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A
          common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of
          IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account.
          For more information on VPC peering failures, see
          `https\\://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html>`__

          * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been successfully deleted.

           **Spot instance events:**

          * INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute
          notification.

           **Other fleet events:**

          * FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings (desired
          instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity
          settings.

          * FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was made to the fleet's

    - **AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --*

      Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player
      rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for
      an acceptable match.

    - **AcceptanceRequired** *(boolean) --*

      Flag that determines whether a match that was created with this configuration must be
      accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.

    - **RuleSetName** *(string) --*

      Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking
      configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.

    - **NotificationTarget** *(string) --*

      SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.

    - **AdditionalPlayerCount** *(integer) --*

      Number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the
      configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional
      player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match.

    - **CustomEventData** *(string) --*

      Information to attach to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.

    * Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set
    minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that
    requires all eight slots to be filled.

    * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to
    evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player
    attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might
    specify a player's skill or level.

    * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on
    player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams,
    or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill
    level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or the match to have a
    minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be
    evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.

    * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time
    when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into
    games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best
    possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill
