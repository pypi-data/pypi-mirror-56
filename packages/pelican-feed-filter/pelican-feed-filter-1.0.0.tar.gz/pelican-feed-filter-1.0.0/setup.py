Both feed paths and filters are matched using [Unix shell-stye wildcards][1].\n\nFilters are defined as:\n* `include.item attribute`\n* `exclude.item_attribute`\n\nwhere `item_attribute` can be any [feed item attribute][2], ie. `title`, `link`, `author_name`, `categories`, ...\n\nYou can also match `pubdate` and `updateddate` item attributes as strings formatted with the following format: `%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S` (e.g. \'Thu, 28 Jun 2001 14:17:15\')\n\n**Filter priorities**\n\nIf an inclusion filter is defined, only feed elements that match the filter will be included in the feed.\n\nIf an exclusion filter is defined, all feed elements except those which match the filter will be included in the feed.\n\nIf both include and exclude filters are defined, all feed elements except those which match some exclusion filter but no inclusion filter, will be included in the feed.\n\nIf multiple inclusion/exclusion filters are defined for the same feed path, a single match is enough to include the item in the feed.\n\nUsage examples\n--------------\n\n* Include only posts in some categories into the global feed:\n```\nFEED_ATOM = \'feed/atom\'\nFEED_RSS = \'feed/rss\'\nFEED_FILTER = {\n    \'feed/*\': {\n        \'include.categories\': [\'software-*\', \'programming\']\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* Exclude an author from a category feed:\n```\nCATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = \'feed/{slug}.atom\'\nCATEGORY_FEED_RSS = \'feed/{slug}.rss\'\nFEED_FILTER = {\n    \'feed/a-category-slug.*\': {\n        \'exclude.author_name\': \'An Author name\'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* Exclude an author from all category feeds:\n```\nCATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = \'feed/{slug}.atom\'\nCATEGORY_FEED_RSS = \'feed/{slug}.rss\'\nFEED_FILTER = {\n    \'feed/*.*\': {\n        \'exclude.author_name\': \'An Author name\'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* In the global feed, exclude all posts in a category, except if written by a given author:\n```\nFEED_ATOM = \'feed/atom\'\nFEED_RSS = \'feed/rss\'\nFEED_FILTER = {\n    \'feed/*\': {\n        \'include.author_name\': \'An Author name\',\n        \'exclude.category\': \'software-development\'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* In the global feed, exclude all posts whose title starts with "Review":\n```\nFEED_ATOM = \'feed/atom\'\nFEED_RSS = \'feed/rss\'\nFEED_FILTER = {\n    \'feed/*\': {\n        \'exclude.title\': \'Review*\'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* In the global feed, include all posts written by a given author OR in a certain category, except if the title starts with "Review":\n```\nFEED_ATOM = \'feed/atom\'\nFEED_RSS = \'feed/rss\'\nFEED_FILTER = {\n    \'feed/*\': {\n        \'include.author_name\': \'An Author name\',\n        \'include.category\': \'software-development\'\n        \'exclude.title\': \'Review*\'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions are welcome and much appreciated.
