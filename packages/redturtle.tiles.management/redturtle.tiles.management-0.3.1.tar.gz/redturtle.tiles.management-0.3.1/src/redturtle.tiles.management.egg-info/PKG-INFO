        ==============================================================================
        redturtle.tiles.management
        ==============================================================================
        
        A tiles management system, easier than plone.app.mosaic that uses
        `plone.app.tiles`__ and `Mockup`__ functionalities to build a simple UI.

        Features
        --------
        
        - Simple UI to add/remove/edit registered tiles
        - Tiles sorting with drag-and-drop (thanks to mockup)
        - Base view and macro to be reused in custom templates
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use this feature, you only need to do 2 simple steps:
        
        1) Make you view implements IBlocksTransformEnabled interface::
        
            from plone.app.blocks.interfaces import IBlocksTransformEnabled
            from Products.Five import BrowserView
            from zope.interface import implementer
        
            @implementer(IBlocksTransformEnabled)
            class MyView(BrowserView):
                ...
        
        2) use a specific macro in the template, where you want to insert the tiles::
        
            <tal:tiles metal:use-macro="context/tiles_view/macros/tiles-macro" />
        
        3) the used tiles need to expose their id to allows the UI to handle correct actions::
        
            <div data-tileid="${view/id}">
              .. your tile html
            </div>
        
        The last point can be improved because with this restriction we can't use standard tiles, but only custom tiles.
        
        After this, you see a new "Add tile" button in the view, and clicking on it,
        you can see a list of available tiles.
        
        Translations
        ------------
        
        This product has been translated into
        
        - Italian
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install redturtle.tiles.management by adding it to your buildout::
        
           [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                redturtle.tiles.management
        
        
        and then running "bin/buildout"
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        This package is developed with mockup, so is fully compatible for Plone 5.
        
        For Plone 4 there is an additional javascript with some mockup's patterns used for
        drag and drop behavior.
        
        You need to include two javascripts in your view template or register them in
        the global jsregistry. I don't want to register globally these resources
        because they are used only in one single view:
        
        - `++resource++redturtle.tiles.management/mockup.min.js`
        - `++resource++redturtle.tiles.management/integration.js`
