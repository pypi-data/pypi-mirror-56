    Given a password and salt[1] return a hash string that cannot be reversed

    The name of the hash used and the number of iterations performed can be
    specified, by default the hash used is 'sha256' and the number of itertaions
    is 100,000.

    NOTE: When running tests it can be a good idea to specify a lower number of
    iterations (e.g 1) as the default 100,000 takes a while and can dramatically
    increase the amount of time it takes for tests to complete.

    NOTE: Remember the salt needs to be stored along with the password hash,
    without the salt it's not possible to test if a password from a user is
    correct.
