Description: # Cert Session
        
        ## Background
        
        http://westside-consulting.blogspot.com/2019/10/certsession.html
        
        ## Summary
        
        This package provides an object, **CertSession**,
        based on [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/requests/sessions.py).session
        that takes an alternate issuer certificate
        or issuer certificates collection as its single argument.
        Subsequent http requests made with this object will use both the given issuer certificate collection
        as well as the certificate collection provided by **certifi**.
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install cert_session
        
        ## Usage
        
            from certsession import Session
            session = Session('/path/to/my-root-certificates.pem')
            response = session.get('https://my-web-service/...')
