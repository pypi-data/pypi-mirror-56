What is E-Cell System?
----------------------

E-Cell System is a software platform for modeling, simulation and analysis of complex, heterogeneous and multi-scale systems like a cell.

E-Cell4 accepts multi-algorithms, multi-timescales and multi-spatial-representations as its central feature.

Features
--------

- Single particle simulations, i.e. [The enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (eGFRD) method](http://gfrd.org), [Spatiocyte](http://spatiocyte.org) (a lattice-based method), and the Reaction Brownian Dynamics (RBD) method
- Ordinary differential equations, Gillespie algorithm (the direct method), and spatial Gillespie algorithm (the next subvolume method)
- Rule-based modeling
- Python programmable

Try online
----------

You can try this package online with Google Colaboratory.
