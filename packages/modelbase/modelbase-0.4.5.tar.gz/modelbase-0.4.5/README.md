# modelbase

modelbase is a python package to help you build and analyze dynamic mathematical models of biological systems. It has originally been designed for the simulation of metabolic systems, but can be used for virtually any processes, in which some substances get converted into others.

modelbase incorporates an easy construction method to define 'reactions'. A rate law and the stoichiometry need to be specified, and the system of differential equations is assembled automatically.

modelbase allows 'algebraic modules', which are useful to implement rapid equilibrium or quasi steady-state approximations. In the simplest instance, they allow easy incorporation of conserved quantities.

modelbase also allows a simple construction of isotope-specific models. This class contains a constructor method that automatically construct all isotope specific versions of a particular reaction. Very cool - check it out!

## Release notes
Version 0.4.0 introduces changes not compatible with the previous official 
release 0.2.5. API changes are summarised in docs/api_changes.ipynb.

[Version 0.2.5](https://gitlab.com/ebenhoeh/modelbase/-/tags/initial-release) 
is the official release for the submission of the
mansucript "Building mathematical models of biological systems
with modelbase, a Python package for semi-automatic ODE assembly
and construction of isotope-specific models" to the Journal of Open
Research Software.

See changelog.md for details on changes of earlier versions.
