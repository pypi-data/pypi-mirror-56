        notes
        -----
        
        You can't just install all listed apps. Some of them are essential system app and deinstall will brick or damages the OS!
        
        There are two modes:
        
        * ``uninstall apps`` - Will deinstall the package for the current user
        
        * ``deactivate apps`` - Will only deactivate the package for the current user
        
        It's safer to just deactivate the apps ;)
        
        uninstall / locked apps
        =======================
        
        There is a list of apk package names that are "locked" in PyAdbUninstall
        
        But this list is incomplete!
        
        The list is ``LOCKED_APPS`` in:
        
        * `adb_uninstall/constants.py <https://github.com/jedie/PyAdbUninstall/blob/master/adb_uninstall/constants.py>`_
        
        Please help to complete this list by github pull request ;)

        package actions by hand via adb
        -------------------------------
        
        Check / init adb connection:
        
        ::
        
            # Just show version information:
            $ adb version
            Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.36
            Revision 1:7.0.0+r33-2
            
            # List of devices attached:
            $ adb devices -l
            
            # kill the adb server if it is running:
            $ adb kill-server
            
            # Kick current connection from host side and make it reconnect:
            $ adb reconnect
        
        List all installed apk packages:
        
        ::
        
            $ adb shell pm list packages
        
        Deactivate one apk package:
        
        ::
        
            $ adb shell pm disable-user <packagname>
        
        Uninstall one apk package:
        
        ::
        
            $ adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <packagname>
        
        * ``-k`` - keep the data and cache directories
        
        * ``--user 0`` - Deinstall only for current user
        
        -------
        Startup
        -------
        
        ::
        
            # clone repository from github:
            ~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/PyAdbUninstall.git
            
            ~$ cd PyAdbUninstall
            ~/PyAdbUninstall$ pipenv sync
            
            # Start GUI:
            ~/PyAdbUninstall$ pipenv run adb_uninstall
