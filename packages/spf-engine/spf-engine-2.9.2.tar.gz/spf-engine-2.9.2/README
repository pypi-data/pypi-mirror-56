=================

This is an external policy checker for the postfix mail server.  It will use
pyspf to check SPF records to determine if email should be rejected or
deferred by your server.

To install from the tar.gz (if this software has been packaged for your
distribution, the packaged version is recommended and should be installed
using your normal distribution packaging tools):

1.  Extract the package from the tarball (tar -xvvzf ...)
2.  Enter the package directory (cd ...)
3.  As root:
python3 setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record=/dev/null

It requires Python3 (python3.3+) - as of version 2.0.0, python2 is no longer
supported, the pyspf (python-spf) library version 2.0.9 or higher, and authres.  

Nothing is configured by default, so this will not interact with Postfix until
it has been set up.

See man 1 policyd-spf for information on setting up and using this policy
server.

See man 5 policyd-spf.conf for configuration file information.

The milter is new and not well tested/mature.

This package includes a default configuration file and man pages.  For those
to be installed when installing using setup.py, the following incantation is
required because setuptools developers decided not being able to do this by
default is a feature:

python3 setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record=/dev/null

For users of Debian Stable (Debian 9, Codename Squueze), all dependencies are
available in either the main or backports repositories:

[sudo] apt install python-milter python-nacl python-ipaddress python-dnspython
[sudo] apt install -t stretch-backports python-authres python-dkim

The preferred method of installation is from PyPi using pip (if distribution
packages are not available):

[sudo] pip install pyspf_milter

Using pip will cause required packages to be installed via easy_install if they
have not been previously installed.  Because pymilter is a compiled Python
extension, the system will need appropriate development packages and
an C compiler.  Alternately, install it from dsitribution/OS packages and then
pip install dkimpy_milter.

Both a systemd unit file and a sysv init file are provided.  Both make
assumptions about defaults being used, e.g. if a non-standard pidfile name is
used, they will need to be updated.  The sysv init file uses start-stop-deamon
from Debian.  It is not portable to systems without that available.

The pyspf-milter drops priviledges after setup to the user/group specified in
UserID.  During initial setup, this system user needs to be manually created.
As an example, using the default dkimpy-user on Debian, the command would be:

[sudo] adduser --system --no-create-home --quiet --disabled-password \
               --disabled-login --shell /bin/false --group \
               --home /run/pyspf-milter pyspf-milter

Since /var/run or /run is sometimes on a tempfs, if the PID file directory is
missing, the milter will create it on startup.

To start pyspf-milter with systemd for the first time, you will need to take
the following steps:

[sudo] systemctl daemon-reload
[sudo] systemctl enable pyspf-milter
[sudo] systemctl start pyspf-milter
[sudo] systemctl status pyspf-milter (to verify it started correctly)

As with all milters, pyspf-milter needs to be integrated with your MTA of
choice (Sendmail or Postfix).

For Sendmail:

Configuration is very similar to opendkim, but needs some adjustment for
dkimpy-milter. Here's an example configuration line to include in your
sendmail.mc:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`pyspf-milter', `S=local:/run/pyspf-milter/pyspf-milter.sock')dnl

Changing the sendmail.mc file requires a Make (to compile it into sendmail.cf)
and a restart of sendmail.  Note that S= needs to match the value of Socket in
the configuration file.

Milter support should be present by default in most versions of sendmail
these days, but if not included in your Sendmail build, see:
http://www.elandsys.com/resources/sendmail/milter.html

For Postfix:

Integration of pyspf-milter into Postfix is like any milter (See Postfix's
README_FILES/MILTER_README).  Here's an example master.cf excerpt:

smtp       inet  n       -       -       -      -       smtpd
    ...
    -o smtpd_milters=inet:localhost:8893
    ...

These need to match the Socket value for pyspf-milter.

Care is required to segregate outbound mail from inbound mail to be checked.
verified.  There are many possible ways.  Here is another example using milter
macros to keep the mail streams segregated:

Postfix main.cf:

smtpd_milters=inet:localhost:8893

Postfix master.cf:

smtp       inet  n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
    ...
    -o milter_macro_daemon_name=VERIFYING
    ...


In the pyspf-milter configuration file:

...
MacroList		daemon_name|VERIFYING
...
