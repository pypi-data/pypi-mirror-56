        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Flask-Error-Monitor is a batteries-included, simple-to-use `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension that lets you
        add error recording interfaces to Flask applications. It's implemented in such a way that the developer has total control of the resulting application.
        
        Out-of-the-box, Flask-Error-Monitor plays nicely with various ORM's, including
        
        - `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
        
        - `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_,
        
        
        It also boasts a simple Model management interface.
        
        The biggest feature of Flask-Error-Monitor is flexibility. To start off with you can create a very simple application in no time,
        with exception monitor enabled, but then you can go further and customize different aspects.
        
        Flask-Error-Monitor is an active project, well-tested and production ready.
