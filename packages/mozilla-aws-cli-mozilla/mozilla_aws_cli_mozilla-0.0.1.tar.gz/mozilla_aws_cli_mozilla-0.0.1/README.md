# mozilla_aws_cli_mozilla

This Python package implements the `mozilla_aws_cli_config` API and configures
a deployment of `mozilla_aws_cli` with the specific configuration settings for
Mozilla employees and contributors.

This package is only needed if you intend to use the `mozilla_aws_cli` to access
AWS accounts owned by Mozilla.
