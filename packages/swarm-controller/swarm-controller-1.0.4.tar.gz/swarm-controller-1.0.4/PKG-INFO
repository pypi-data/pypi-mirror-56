This is a simple command line program to manage the bootstrapping 
and maintenance of a Docker Swarm Cluster.

Currently only AWS is supported (requiring access to the 
metadata service). Eventually we will allow other metadata
stores like etcd or Consul.

## Installation

```
pip install swarm-controller
```

## Usage

Bootstrap a node:
```
swarm-ctl bootstrap
```

Cleanup & Maintenance
```
swarm-ctl cleanup
swarm-ctl relabel
```

## Tests

```
poetry run tox
```
