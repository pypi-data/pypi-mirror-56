funannotate is a pipeline for genome annotation (built specifically for fungi, but will also work with higher eukaryotes). Installation, usage, and more information can be found at [http://funannotate.readthedocs.io](http://funannotate.readthedocs.io)

#### Quickstart:

COMING SOON: the pipeline can be installed with conda (via bioconda):
```
#add appropriate channels
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

#then create environment
conda create -n funannotate funannotate
```

To install just the python funannotate package, you can do this with pip:
```
pip install funannotate
```
