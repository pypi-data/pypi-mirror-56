      ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types. This IP address is temporarily unavailable when the file
      system is undergoing maintenance. For Linux and Windows SMB clients that are joined to an
      Active Directory, use the file system's DNSName instead. For more information and instruction
      on mapping and mounting file shares, see

    - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --*

      A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups. This
      value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to all
      automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If
      this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to
      backups.

          A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to backups.
          This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied

            ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If a prefix is specified after the Amazon S3

          - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

            The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to store new and

            For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe count and
            maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum
            number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number
            of disks that make up the file system.

            The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB).

      Required when ``DeploymentType`` is set to ``MULTI_AZ_1`` . This specifies the subnet in which
      you want the preferred file server to be located. For in-AWS applications, we recommend that

      name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

    - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

      (Optional) The path in Amazon S3 where the root of your Amazon FSx file system is exported.
      The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an
      optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from your Amazon FSx for
      Lustre file system. If an ``ExportPath`` value is not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default
      export path, ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`` . The timestamp is in UTC

      The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket specified by ``ImportPath``

      file system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data in S3 is
      overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the export path, such as

            bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the file system.

          - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

            The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to store new and

            of disks that make up the file system.

            The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB).

              clients that are not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory. Applicable for both
              ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` and ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types. This IP address is temporarily
              unavailable when the file system is undergoing maintenance. For Linux and Windows SMB
              clients that are joined to an Active Directory, use the file system's DNSName instead.
