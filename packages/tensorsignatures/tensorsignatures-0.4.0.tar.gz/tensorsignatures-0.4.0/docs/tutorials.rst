Getting started
===============

TensorSignatures deciphers mutational signatures in context transcription,
replication and arbitrary genomic environments, which is achieved by partitioning
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to different states dependent on their
genomic location, and representing this data in a multidimensional array (tensor).
Additionally, the algorithm takes a secondary mutation matrix as input to link
other variant types to these signatures by sharing their exposure. In the following
tutorial, we want to convey an intutition for working with such highdimensional
data and explain the usage of the :code:`tensorsignatures` API and command line
interface by

1. simulating data set
2. running Tensorsignatures
3. exploring inferred parameters.


Creating sample data with :code:`TensorSignatureData`
-----------------------------------------------------

The :code:`tensorsignatures.data` module provides the :obj:`TensorSignatureData`
class allowing us to create simulated data, which we will explore in the
following to understand the meaning of various parameters of the model. To
create such data, we load the module and initalize :obj:`TensorSignatureData`
object

>>> import tensorsignatures as ts
>>> data_set = ts.TensorSignatureData(seed=573, rank=3, samples=100, dimensions=[3, 5], mutations=1000)

which will create a dataset comprising 100 cancer genomes (:code:`samples`)
exposed to three signatures (:code:`rank`) each with 1000 mutations. By passing
the list :code:`[3, 5]` to the :code:`dimension` argument, we create two additional
genomic dimensions with size 3 and 5 respectively. To obtain the SNV count tensor,
we invoke the :code:`snv` method of :code:`data_set`, which returns a
multidimensional array.

>>> snv = data_set.snv()
>>> snv.shape
(3, 3, 3, 5, 96, 100)

The shape attribute of the :code:`snv` object is tuple of :code:`int` s indicating
the size of the array in each dimension. TensorSignatures expects input data to follow
a specific structure which is explained in the following table.

+----------------------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------+

From this we can see that our simulated :code:`data_set` contains two additional
genomic dimensions with size 3 and 5 respectively.

Note, that we can reconstruct the :math:`p\times n` mutation count matrix, which
usually serves as an input for conventional mutational signature analysis, by summing
over all dimensions except the last two (representint base substitution types
and samples respectively). The following code illustrates this operation.

>>> snv_collapsed = snv.sum(axis=(0,1,2,3,))

To inspect the mutational spectra of the first 9 samples we excecute.

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, sharey=True, sharex=True)
>>> for i, ax in enumerate(np.ravel(axes)):
>>>    ax.bar(np.arange(96), snv_collapsed[:, i], color=ts.DARK_PALETTE)
>>>    ax.set_title('Sample {}'.format(i))
>>>    if i%3==0: ax.set_ylabel('Counts')
>>>    if i>=6: ax.set_xlabel('Mutation type')

.. figure::  images/samples.png
   :align:   center

However, by first selecting a specific states and then summing over all
remaining dimensions, we can reveal changes across different genomic dimensions
or states. For example, to get all coding and template strand mutations of the
dataset we could compute

>>> snv_coding = snv[0,].sum(axis=(0,1,2,4))
>>> snv_template = snv[1,].sum(axis=(0,1,2,4))

and then inspect both spectra by

>>> fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True)
>>> axes[0].bar(np.arange(96), snv_coding, color=ts.DARK_PALETTE)
>>> axes[0].set_title('Coding strand mutations')
>>> axes[1].bar(np.arange(96), snv_template, color=ts.DARK_PALETTE)
>>> axes[1].set_title('Template strand mutations')

.. figure::  images/transcription.png
   :align:   center

which reveals that especially C>A (blue), C>T (red) and T>A (grey) mutations
are more prevalent on coding strand DNA.

By indexing the the SNV tensor appropriately we can also recover mutational
spectra from different state combinations, eg. :code:`snv[0,:,2].sum(axis=(0,1))`
would return a :math:`p\times n` matrix representing the coding strand
mutations in state 2 of the first additional genomic dimension.

To summarize, in this section we created a simulated SNV tensor using the
:obj:`tensorsignatures.util.TensorSignatureData` class. TensorSignatures features
the characterization of mutational processes across an arbitrary number of
genomic dimensions and states, but requires the user structure their input array in
specified manner. The SNV count tensor must contain transcriptional and
replicational variants in the first two dimension, and specify base substitutions
as well as samples in the last two dimensions. To recover mutational spectra
in specific contexts, the SNV count tensor has to be indexed and summed over
all remaining dimensions (except the ones containing base substitutions and
samples).

Understanding transcriptional and replicational biases
------------------------------------------------------

In the previous section, we created a example dataset using the
:obj:`TensorSignaturesData` object and investigated the data by plotting
mutational spectra in various genomic contexts. While doing this, we discovered
that some variant types seem to occur with higher frequency on conding strand
DNA as compared to their equivalents on template DNA. Such phenomena have been
observed in several mutational processes and are, for example, attributed to DNA
repair mechanisms such as transcription coupled repair (TCR), which actively
depletes mutations gene encoding regions.

TensorSignatures models variability in mutagenesis due to transcription and
replication by

1. extracting separate mutational spectra for coding and template strand DNA, and lead and lagging strand DNA
2. fitting a scalar for each signature that quantifies the overall shift of mutations in pyrimidine context (bias matrix :code:`b`)
3. fitting a scalar for each signature that is interpreted as the relative signature activity of signature in transcribed vs untranscribed regions, and early and late replicating regions (activity matrix :code:`a`).

To understand this, we can plot the underlying signatures that created :code:`snv`
by

>>> plt.figure(figsize=(16, 3))
>>> ts.plot_signatures(data_set.S.reshape(3,3,-1,96,3))

.. figure::  images/signatures.png
   :align:   center

which reveals the SNV spectra of three signatures (rows) for transcription and
replication in the left and right column, respectively. In this representation
darker bars indicate for mutation type probabilities for coding strand and leading
strand DNA, while the lighter bars show them for template and lagging strand DNA.



Plotting the trinucleotide profile of the first samples reveals that samples
are dominated by C>A (blue) and T>C (green).





which illustrates that shown samples above are a superposition of both signatures.
