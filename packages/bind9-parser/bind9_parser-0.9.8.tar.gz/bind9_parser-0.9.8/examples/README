The examples that are practical at the moment are:

    parse-bind9 - Most practical of all, actually
                  parses ISC Bind into Python Dict structure

    flatten_namedconf  - Reads in all include files and creates a single file.

    isc_boolean - ISC Bind9 boolean syntax (it's complex)

    exclamation - Exercise the use of 'exclamation' mark.

    namedconfglobal.py - Is a Pythonized database that contains all things
                         related to ISC Bind syntax handling, except for
                         its BNF (that's what bind9-parser is for)..
