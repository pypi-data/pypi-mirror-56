[setResultsName] returns a copy of the original ParserElement object; this is so
that the client can define a basic element, such as an integer, and reference it
in multiple places with different names.


- The required zone files may differ in each view, for example,
    there is no need to provide localhost zones in the "badguys" view.

- view clauses are processed in the order in which
  they appear in the named.conf file.

- Recursion has been removed in the "badguys" view for
  performance and security reasons.

- Current versions of BIND will refuse to load such
  configurations. If incoming queries are not matched
  to a particular view then Server Error is typically returned.
        To avoid such problems the last view defined should use:
            match-clients {any};

- 'slave' servers for each zone will see a single 'zone'
  based on their IP address, for instance, "trusted" or "badguys".
  However, if you multi-home or 'alias' the IP address on the 'slave'
  server you could get both views.
  Slave DNS Servers with View Clause When using a Slave
  server with view clauses it is important to recall that, even
  when NOTIFY is used, the Slave always initiates the zone
  tranfer operation using an INCOMING DNS operation (TCP on Port 53 normally).
    To ensure the correct zone file is transferred the match-clients and/or
    match-destinations statements associated with the views must ensure that the
    requesting Slave server's IP is directed to the view containing
    the zone file that should be tranferred.
