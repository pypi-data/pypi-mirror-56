                  fast lower bounds and valid inequalities for integer
                  linear optimization problems. However, almost all
                  the functions proposed in the literature are defined
                  only for positive arguments, which restricts
                  considerably their applicability. The

                  functions with general domains remain mostly
                  unknown. In this paper, we show that extending these
                  functions to negative arguments raises many
                  issues. We explore these functions in depth with a
                  focus on maximal functions, i.e. the family of
                  non-dominated functions. The knowledge of these
                  properties is fundamental to derive good families of
                  general maximal dual-feasible functions that might
                  lead to strong cuts for integer linear optimization
                  problems and strong lower bounds for combinatorial

                  functions. In this paper we study the relationships
                  between these two descriptions. Our results have
                  implications for finite dimensional corner
                  polyhedra. One consequence is that nonnegative
                  continuous functions suffice to describe finite
                  dimensional corner polyhedra with rational data. We
                  also discover new facts about corner polyhedra with

                  nowadays an integral part of all general purpose
                  software to solve MIP. The most prominent,and
                  computationally significant, class of general
                  cutting planes are Gomory mixed integer cuts
                  (GMI). However finding other classes of general cuts
                  for MIP that work well in practice has been
                  elusive. Recent advances on the understanding of
                  valid inequalities derived from the infinite
                  relaxation introduced by Gomory and Johnson for
                  mixed integer problems, has opened a new possibility
                  of finding such an extension. In this paper, we
                  investigate the computational impact of using a
                  subclass of minimal valid inequalities from the
                  infinite relaxation, using different number of
                  tableau rows simultaneously, based on a simple
                  separation procedure. We test these ideas on a set
                  of MIPs, including MIPLIB 3.0 and MIPLIB 2003, and
                  show that they can improve MIP performance even when
                  compared against commercial software performance.",

                  programs from multiple rows of the simplex tableau,
                  the usual approach has been to relax the integrality
                  of the non-basic variables, compute an intersection
                  cut, then strengthen the cut coefficients
                  corresponding to integral non-basic variables using
                  the so-called trivial lifting procedure. Although of
                  polynomial-time complexity in theory, this lifting
                  procedure can be computationally costly in
                  practice. For the case of two-row relaxations, we
                  present a practical algorithm that computes trivial
                  lifting coefficients in constant time, for arbitrary
                  maximal lattice-free sets. Computational experiments
                  confirm that the algorithm works well in practice.",

  abstract     = "Mixed-integer rounding (MIR) inequalities play a
                  central role in the development of strong cutting
                  planes for mixed-integer programs. In this paper, we
                  investigate how known MIR inequalities can be
                  combined in order to generate new strong valid
                  inequalities.{\textparagraph}Given a mixed-integer
                  region S and a collection of valid ``base''
                  mixed-integer inequalities, we develop a procedure
                  for generating new valid inequalities for S. The
                  starting point of our procedure is to consider the
                  MIR inequalities related with the base
                  inequalities. For any subset of these MIR
                  inequalities, we generate two new inequalities by
                  combining or ``mixing'' them. We show that the new
                  inequalities are strong in the sense that they fully
                  describe the convex hull of a special mixed-integer
                  region associated with the base
                  inequalities.{\textparagraph}We discuss how the
                  mixing procedure can be used to obtain new classes
                  of strong valid inequalities for various
                  mixed-integer programming problems. In particular,
                  we present examples for production planning,
                  capacitated facility location, capacitated network
                  design, and multiple knapsack problems. We also
                  present preliminary computational results using the
                  mixing procedure to tighten the formulation of some
                  difficult integer programs. Finally we study some
                  extensions of this mixing procedure.",

                  generated from two or more rows of the optimal
                  simplex tableau. One can construct examples of
                  integer programs for which a single cutting plane
                  generated from two rows dominates the entire split
                  closure. Motivated by these theoretical results, we
                  study the effect of adding a family of cutting
                  planes generated from two rows on a set of instances
                  from the MIPLIB library. The conclusion of whether
                  these cuts are competitive with Gomory mixed-integer
                  cuts is very sensitive to the experimental setup. In
                  particular, we consider the issue of reliability

                  extreme valid functions for the k-dimensional
                  infinite group problem. In particular, we present
                  the general regular solution to Cauchy's additive
                  functional equation on restricted lower-dimensional
                  convex domains. This provides a k-dimensional
                  generalization of the so-called Interval Lemma,
                  allowing us to deduce affine properties of the
                  function from certain additivity relations. Next, we
                  study the discrete geometry of additivity domains of
                  piecewise linear functions, providing a framework
                  for finite tests of minimality and extremality. We
                  then give a theory of non-extremality certificates
                  in the form of perturbation functions. We apply
                  these tools in the context of minimal valid
                  functions for the two-dimensional infinite group
                  problem that are piecewise linear on a standard
                  triangulation of the plane, under a regularity
                  condition called diagonal constrainedness. We show
                  that the extremality of a minimal valid function is
                  equivalent to the extremality of its restriction to
                  a certain finite two-dimensional group problem. This
                  gives an algorithm for testing the extremality of a
                  given minimal valid function.",

                  procedure combining mixed integer rounding with

                  integer programs. The survey contains essentially
                  two parts. In the first we present lifting in a very
                  general way, emphasizing superadditive lifting which
                  allows one to lift simultaneously different sets of
                  variables. In the second, our procedure for
                  generating strong valid inequalities consists of
                  reduction to a knapsack set with a single continuous
                  variable, construction of a mixed integer rounding

                  on knowing the order of the group. From a diamond
                  gauge function the algorithm constructs a continuous
                  function $\pi$, which is shown to be subadditive on
                  the unit hypercube. Such continuous functions yield
                  valid inequalities and are used in solving the group
                  problem.",
