In short, TSM is a Python module that contains a few functions for analyzing Twitter and Twitter-like (i.e., directed and very sparse with community structure) network data. I wrote it for my own research purposes but thought someone out there might find it useful.


Here are some of the things TSM can do:

- Support very large communities (millions of nodes/edges)--the only limit is your computer's memory
- Extract retweets and @-mentions into edgelist format for network
  analysis and visualization
- Partition networks into communities, isolate the N largest
  communities, and identify the most-connected users in each community
- Measure the insularity of network communities (using EI indices) to
  determine the extent to which each looks like an echo chamber
- Measure the overlap between network communities to determine which
  ones interact more and less often
- Get the top retweets in a Twitter dataset and rank them by N of
  retweets and by community
- Track Twitter (or other) communities over time: compute similarity
  scores (weighted or unweighted Jaccard coefficients) for partitioned
  network communities drawn from the same dataset at two different
  time slices
- Discover which nodes intermediate between which communities
- Find the most-used hashtags in each community (or dataset)
- Find the most-used hyperlinks or web domains in each community (or dataset)


Here's what you need to use TSM:

- ``tsm.py``, the TSM Python module provided here
- `python-louvain`_, Thomas Aynaud's Python
  implementation of the Louvain method of network community
  detection. 
- `NetworkX`_, a widely-used Python module for general network
  analysis. 
- `Python`_ 3.x (needed for Unicode support)

.. _python-louvain: https://bitbucket.org/taynaud/python-louvain
.. _NetworkX: http://networkx.github.io/
.. _Python: https://www.python.org/


See ``tsm.py`` for a full description of TSM's functions and how to use them. The module should work as long as NetworkX and ``python-louvain`` are installed.

The ``TSM demo files.zip`` file contains two IPython notebooks and a Twitter ID file that can be used to demo many of TSM's functions. Code and instructions are provided to hydrate the Twitter ID file. For testing purposes, here is a very brief (fabricated) sample demonstrating how input data for the ``t2e`` function should be formatted in a plain text file. This sample was created by Devin Gaffney (`@DGaffney <https://github.com/DGaffney>`_)::

    dgaff,"Twitter is pretty fun, isn't it, @dfreelon?"
    dfreelon,Yes indeed @dgaff - @some_other_user weigh in?
    some_other_user,Of course twitter is grand. Mostly because of @dril.
    dril,Some weird tweet no one understands but everyone favorites @some_other_user
    cnnbrk,Looks like @dril just tweeted

I gratefully acknowledge funding support from the US Institute of Peace in creating this module.
