Basketball advanced analytics and statistics have gained popularity in recent years, in parallel with the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Recently, the NBA has launched a competition (https://www.nbadatachallenge.com/) to predict game scores using historical data. In fact, in order to predict the effect of a player or a lineup on a game, historical data can be used to predict such impact. Data are generally individual, in the sense that they record statistics of a single player, and not statistics of the whole team when a specific player was on the court. Such data can be "myopic", in the sense that being focus in single-player performances, they might fail to fully reveal the effect of a player on his/her teammates while on the floor.
Using pyHoops, a play-by-play report of a basketball game can be web-parsed, and basketball statistics (for the whole own team and opposing team) per lineup and per player can be easily computed.
