Description: XPY
        ===
        
        This is an "eXtended" Python console, which really just means a Python console
        done just the way that I like it.  Primarily, this means enhanced readline
        history support, and X clipboard utilities.
        
        1. Python readline history is now stored in git, by default under a repository
           named ~/.pyhist
        
        2. Multiple instances of the console will have their histories union-merged
           under the shared git repo.  This means no more clobbering of readline
           history.
        
        3. X Clipboard helper called Clip, e.g., Clip.run(), Clip.read_to_history(),
           Clip.write_from_history(), etc. are available and made visible to the xpy
           console.
        
        4. The fancy, colorized, full-stack exception traceback display may help you to
           analyze code issues.
        
        5. The xpy console can be inserted into code using
        
             import xpy; xpy.xpy_start_console()
        
           This will break into an interactive console local to the current frame.  It
           is not a debugger, but it is an ordinary interactive Python console.  Any
           code runs within the scope of the frame where the command is run.
        
        6. Script commands include xpy (autogenerated, slower startup), xpy2, and xpy3
           for starting an interactive console.  It can also be started with python -m
           xpy or python3 -m xpy.  The console is exited with Ctrl-D.
        
        7. Tab completion that works within the local console frame.
