 ropee, a python refactoring library ...
================================================


Overview
========

`ropee`_ is a customized branch I maintain that is based off the python
refactoring library, `rope`_. All related documentation can be found in its
repository.

The difference will usually be the more immediate availability of features I'm
personally interested in. PRs will most likely also be made upstream.

Artifacts are also uploaded to `pypi`_ for those who want bleeding edge.

Note that I'm piggy backing off of the latest version that is provided by rope,
but they do not correspond to each other in any way.
