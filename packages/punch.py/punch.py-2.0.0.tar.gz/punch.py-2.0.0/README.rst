About punch
-----------

Punch is a configurable version updater, and you can use to automate the
management of your project's version number.

Punch stores the version of your project in its own file. Each time you
need to update it, Punch runs through the configured files and replaces
the old version with the new one. Additionally, Punch may also
automatically commit the version change on your VCS of choice.

This project has been heavily inspired by
`bumpversion <https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion>`__, and I want to
thank Filip Noetzel, the author of that project for his work and the
inspiring ideas.

Installation
------------

Punch is available for both Python 2 and Python 3 through pip. Just
create a virtual environment and run

.. code:: sh

    pip install punch.py

To start working with Punch you need a configuration file and a version
file. You may ask Punch to create the two files for you with reasonable
starting values with the flag ``--init``

.. code:: sh

    punch --init

which will create the ``punch_config.py`` and ``punch_version.py`` files
in the current directory.

Contributing
------------

See the CONTRIBUTING file for detailed information. Please remember that
this project is actively developed in the ``develop`` branch, so be sure
to work there if you try to implement new feature of fix bugs.
