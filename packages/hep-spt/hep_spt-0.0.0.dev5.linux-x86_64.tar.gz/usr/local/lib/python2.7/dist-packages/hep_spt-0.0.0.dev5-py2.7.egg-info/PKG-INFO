        The **High Energy Physics Statistics and Plotting Tools** package provides tools to work in **High Energy Physics** using general python packages.
        
        Main points
        ===========
        
          * Functions needed on day-to-day work, like calculating errors, residuals, etc.
          * Classes to create adaptive binned histograms, and some functions to represent them using `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
          * Statistical functions to work with Bayesian/Frequentist approaches.
          * Utilities to handle poissonian and/or weighted histograms.
          * Simple classes to work with the CLs method.
          * A set of `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ styles.
        
        Considerations:
        ===============
        
          * Inputs passed to the functions and classes are usually preferred as `numpy.ndarray <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`_ objects.
          * Plotting functions and classes are designed to work with `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
          * Statistical tools are built on top of the standard `scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_ package.
        
        Installation:
        =============
        
        This package is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_, so simply type
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install hep-spt
        
        to install the package in your current python environment.
        Since this package uses the Numpy C API, it is necessary to have Numpy already installed.
        If you attempt to install "hep_spt" with no installation of Numpy, an error will be raised.
        To use the **latest development version**, clone the repository and install with `pip`:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           git clone https://github.com/mramospe/hep_spt.git
           pip install hep_spt
