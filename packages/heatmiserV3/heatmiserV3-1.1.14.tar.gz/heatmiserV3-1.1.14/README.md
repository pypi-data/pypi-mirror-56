This library has been created from the work carried out by 
Neil Trimboy in 2011 here:
[https://code.google.com/p/heatmiser-monitor-control/]

The library uses the Heatmiser V3 Protocol to communicate 
with a number of thermostats.

As the DCB Structures are different on each thermostat, this
module doesn't yet cover all their intricacies, but with the
connection in place, it provides a raw method of interfacing
directly with the thermostat.

I hope to add specific model support as it gets requested.

## Supported Thermostats

DT/DT-E/PRT/PRT-E/PRT-HW

## Supported Timing Switches

The timing switches have a smaller DCB, but it is possible with
this module to still send raw comamnds to them.

TM1/TM1-N

## Other sensors

Heatmiser have used their V3 protocol in a number of sensors.
Your mileage may vary in attempting to use this library
to communicate with them, but please open a pull request if 
you get something working.

# Requirements

Python needs to be version 3.
