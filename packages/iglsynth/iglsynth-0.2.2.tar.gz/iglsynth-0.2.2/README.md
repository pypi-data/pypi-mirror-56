IGLSynth (Infinite Games on graph &amp; Logic-based controller Synthesis) is a high-level Python API for defining and solving Infinite Games and Logic-based strategy Synthesis. 

It provides an easy interface to

1. Define two-player games-on-graphs.
2. Assign tasks to players using formal logic.
3. Write solvers to compute winning strategies in the game.


See [Documentation Page](http://www.iglsynth.akulkarni.me/en/latest/ ) for installation instructions and API documentation. 

**Note:** IGLSynth is still under development.
