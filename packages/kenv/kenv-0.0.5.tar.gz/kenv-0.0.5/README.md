## Overview

KENV is a solver code for the equation of the envelope of an electron beam with the Kapchinsky-Vladimirsky distribution for accelerator physics.

It is particularly suitable for accelerating an electron beam in direct channels with solenoidal and quadrupole focusing.

## Algorithm

The algorithm reduces to lowering the order of the Kapchinsky-Vladimirsky differential equations to the first and subsequent integration.

## Language

KENV completely written in Python.

## Installation

```
pip install kenv
```
