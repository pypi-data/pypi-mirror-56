Helpers and tools that make working with `conan <https://conan.io>`_  (e.g., scripting) more convenient.

The classes in this package provide an API for (a subset) of the conan features based on wrapping
the conan command line tool. We opted for this approach because the internal conan API, as opposed
to the command line tool, is `not stable at the moment
<https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/3720>`_.

Building the Sphinx Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Sphinx is installed (i.e., ``pip3 install sphinx sphinx-autodoc-typehints``), the HTML API
documentation for this package can be built via the following ``sphinx-build`` invocation:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sphinx-build doc doc/_build/html

Alternatively, the ``sphinx`` command on the setup.py file can be used.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 ./setup.py sphinx

Either way, the API documentation gets automatically generated by executing ``sphinx-apidoc`` first.
The resulting HTML output can be found in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.
