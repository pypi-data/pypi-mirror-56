        # keras JukeBox
        
        This is a UI based hyper-parameter controller, which let's you control the following.
        
        * start, pause and stop a live training.
        * reset the learning rate on dynamically while training is in progress.
        
        more functionalities are to be added
        
        # Dependencies
        
        This package depends on **MQTT** protocol for communication. So, it is expected that an MQTT broker is up and running in 'localhost' at port 1883(default port).
        
        Install it by :
        
        ```
        
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install mosquitto
        sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
        
        ```
        
        Python dependencies:
        
        * python >= 3.6.8
        * paho-mqtt
        * PyQt5
        * tensorflow >= 1.14
        
        **Note: This package is intended and tested for tensorflow-keras api and NOT keras with tensorflow 'backend'**
        
        # Usage
        
        import as 
        
        ```
        
        from keras_jukebox import JukeBoxCallback
        
        ```
        
        and pass it to the fit method of `keras.model`
        
        as follows :
        
        ```
        
        model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=20, callbacks=[JukeBoxCallback(verbose=True)])
        
        ```
        
        and run your training script. You will note that the script gets blocked, this is because it is waiting for a JukeBox UI to capture it's session. 
        Now, in a separate terminal, type:
        
        ```
        
        start_JukeBox
        
        ```
        
        and you should see the UI pop up, note the algorithm is in **pause** mode by default. Hit the play button to start the training.
