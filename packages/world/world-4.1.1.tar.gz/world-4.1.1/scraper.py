"""Very dumb scraper script to extract the latest ISO 3166 database.

In another blow to the open and free internet, ISO has once again put the
country code database behind a paywall.  The way to rebuild the database with
this script is to visit the following URL:

https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search

You have to enable JavaScript, and the select 300 results per page.  Since
there are only 249 entries (as of 2016-08-24), this will give you everything.
You cannot save that page because JavaScript.  Select All, then Copy, then
paste the results into a file.

If you're lucky, the file will mostly have the data, but it will be in a
horrible format.  There's a bunch of boilerplate at the top.  Delete that.
That should leave you with a file that contains the data starting with the
word "Afghanistan".  What should follow is a bunch of records, one per line of
the format:

    Country name in English
    Country name in French
    2-digit alpha code
    3-digit alpha code
    Numeric code

This script consumes that data and builds mapping dictionaries from one to the
other.  We currently only care about the English name, and the 2- and 3- digit
alpha codes.

This script isn't pretty because it doesn't need to be.  UTSL.
