=============================================================================
Login with OAuth2/ OpenId by integrating Authomatic in Plone
=============================================================================

**pas.plugins.authomatic**

Features
--------

Provides OAuth2 and OpenID login capability for Plone:

It integrates the awesome `Authomatic <http://authomatic.github.io/authomatic/reference/providers.html>`_ package in Plone

  Authomatic is a framework agnostic library
  for Python web applications
  with a minimalistic but powerful interface
  which simplifies authentication of users
  by third party providers like Facebook or Twitter
  through standards like OAuth and OpenID.

  *by Author Peter Hudec on Authomatic website*

It has out of the box support for:

OAuth 1.0a providers
    Bitbucket, Flickr, Meetup, Plurk, Twitter, Tumblr, UbuntuOne, Vimeo, Xero, Xing and Yahoo.
OAuth 2.0 providers
    Amazon, Behance, Bitly, Cosm, DeviantART, Eventbrite, Facebook, Foursquare, GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, PayPal, Reddit, Viadeo, VK, WindowsLive, Yammer and Yandex.
OpenID
    python-openid and Google App Engine based OpenID.


Documentation
-------------

- This package will create a view called ``authomatic-handler`` where you can login with different providers
- The view can be used as well to add an identity from a provider to an existing account
- The provider is choosen in the URL so if you call ``/authomatic-handler/PROVIDER`` you will use PROVIDER to login
- You can set the JSON configuration of the plugin in the Controlpanel ``@@authomatic-controlpanel`` (linked under users)
- Example JSON configuration (first level key is the PROVIDER::

    {
        "github": {
            "display": {
                "title": "Github",
                "cssclasses": {
                    "button": "plone-btn plone-btn-default",
                    "icon": "glypicon glyphicon-github"
                },
                "as_form": false
            },
            "propertymap": {
                "email": "email",
                "link": "home_page",
                "location": "location",
                "name": "fullname"
            },
            "class_": "authomatic.providers.oauth2.GitHub",
            "consumer_key": "5c4901d141e736f114a7",
            "consumer_secret": "d4692ca3c0ab6cc1f8b28d3ccb1ea15b61e7ef5c",
            "access_headers": {
                "User-Agent": "Plone Authomatic Plugin"
            }
        },
    }

Installation
------------

Install pas.plugins.authomatic by adding it to your buildout::

   [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        pas.plugins.authomatic


and then running "bin/buildout".

Start Plone and activate the plugin in the addons control-panel.

Go to the Authomatic controlpanel (security section) and configure the plugin.

Configuration parameters for the different authorization are provided as JSON text in there.
JSON is used because of flexibility.
Details at `Authomatics provider section <http://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic/reference/providers.html>`_.

There are some differences in configuration:

- the value of ``"class_"`` has to be a string, which is then resolved as a dotted path.
- each provider can get an optional entry ``display`` with sub-enties such as:

  - ``title`` which is used in the templates instead of the section name.
  - ``iconclasses`` which is applied in the templates to an span.
  - ``buttonclasses`` which is applied in the templates to the button.
  - ``as_form`` (true/false) which renders a form for OpenId providers.

- each provider can get an optional entry ``propertymap``.
  It is a mapping from authomatic/provider user properties to plone user properties, like ``"fullname": "name",``.
  Look at each providers documentation which properties are available.
