### Description

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PyratLabs/MIRbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PyratLabs/MIRbot)

MIR (Modular Information Retrieval Bot) is a modular Python 3 IRC bot that I
wrote based upon Molobot by CodeDemons. It was created for personal uses but I
am releasing it for others to play with. I haven't yet explained how modules
work but I have included one module that I use on ngIRCd.
