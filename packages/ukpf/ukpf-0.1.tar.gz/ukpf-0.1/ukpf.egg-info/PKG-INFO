Description: # ukpf
        
        This project eventually aims to be a complete personal finance package for the UK tax system.
        
        Currently this package purely contains calculations for the following contributions which appear on UK payslips:
        1. Income Tax
        2. National Insurance
        3. Student Loans
        4. Autoenrolement Pension
        
        There are also static methods for calculating:
        1. Simple Interest Rate
        2. Compound Intrest Rate
        
        I am not responsible for any financial decisions made as a result of this code. This project is in an alpha state, expect bugs and use with caution.
        
        Install using:
        ` pip install ukpersonalfinance`
