Chronos
=======

Utilities for parsing time strings in Python.

Building and installation
-------------------------

Before installing chronos you will have to generate some of its modules
as it is explained in `Chronos readme`_ Then, you can simply run

.. code:: shell

   pip install bigml-chronos

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 and Python 3 are currently supported.

The basic third-party dependencies are `isoweek`_ and `pytz`_. These
libraries are automatically installed during the setup.

Running the tests
-----------------

The tests will be run using nose, that is installed on setup. You can
run the test suite simply by issuing

.. code:: shell

   python setup.py nosetests

Basic methods
-------------

Chronos offers the following main functions:

-  With **parse** you can parse a date. You can specify a format name
   with ``format_name``, a list of possible format names with
   ``format_names`` or not specify any format. In the last case,
   ``parse`` will try all the possible formats until it finds the
   correct one:

   .. code:: python

      from bigml_chronos import chronos
      chronos.parse("1969-W29-1", format_name="week-date")

   .. code:: python

      from bigml_chronos import chronos
      chronos.parse("1969-W29-1", format_names=["week-date", "week-date-time"])

   .. code:: python

      from bigml_chronos import chronos
      chronos.parse("7-14-1969 5:36 PM")

-  You can also find the format_name from a date with **find_format**:

   .. code:: python

      from bigml_chronos import parser
      chronos.find_format("1969-07-14Z")

If both ``format_name`` and ``format_names`` are passed, it will try all
the possible formats in ``format_names`` and ``format_name``.

You can find all the supported formats, and an example for each one of
them inside the `test file`_.
