        import sqlite3
        
        from excel_db_connector import ExcelConnector
        
        dbconn = sqlite3.connect('/tmp/temp.db')
        
        
        excel_connector = ExcelConnector(dbconn)
        
        ```
        2. After that you'll be able to extract data from excel and store it in the db
        ```python
        # Create the tables to for all objects
        excel_connector.create_tables('/tmp/create_tables.sql')
