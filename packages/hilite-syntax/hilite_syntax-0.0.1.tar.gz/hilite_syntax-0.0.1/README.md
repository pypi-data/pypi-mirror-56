Lark Grammar to Editor Syntax Files
===================================

This package allows you to generate syntax-highlighing files for code-editors
directly from the Lark grammar file. This allows your lark-generated
parser and the editor-syntax-files to be derived from a single source of 
truth. Additionally, this package obviates the tedious and error-prone task
of writing syntax files for languages.

Currently Supported Editors

- __vim__: use the `VimConverter` module in `lark_to_editor_syntax.vim` module
