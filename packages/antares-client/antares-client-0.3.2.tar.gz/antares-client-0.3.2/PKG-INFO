Description: # antares-client
        
        A light-weight client for receiving alerts from
        [ANTARES](http://antares.noao.edu).
        
        ANTARES is an Alert Broker developed by the [NOAO](http://noao.edu) for ZTF and
        LSST.
        
        The client is available for use as a Python library and as a command line tool.
        Directions for both use cases follow in the [Usage](#usage) section.

        ## Installation
        
        The ANTARES client supports Python versions 3.4 and up. Python 2.X is not
        supported.
        
        You can install using `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install antares-client
        ```
        
        Verify the client installed correctly:
        
        ```bash
        $ antares --version
        antares, version v0.3.2
        ```

        guides, API reference docs, and more.
        
        ## Version Migration
        
        While the ANTARES client is still in beta (pre-1.0) we will likely make a
        handful of breaking changes. This section will help ease your migratory pains.
        Thank you for supporting us in our infancy!
        
        ### 0.2.x to 0.3.x
        
        - The CLI command for streaming alerts from ANTARES, ``antares-client``, has
          been renamed ``antares stream``. Additionally, in 0.2.0 you were able to pass
          topics to ``antares-client`` in a comma-separated list--this functionality has
          been removed in favor of space-separated lists. So, for example, this 0.2.x
          call:
        
          ```
          antares-client extragalactic,nuclear_transient
          ```
        
          should be replaced with this 0.3.x call:
        
          ```
          antares stream extragalactic nuclear_transient
          ```
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        
        Issues? See the
        [documentation](https://noao.gitlab.io/antares/client/troubleshooting) for
        common gotchas and, if you can't find a solution there, please open an issue.
