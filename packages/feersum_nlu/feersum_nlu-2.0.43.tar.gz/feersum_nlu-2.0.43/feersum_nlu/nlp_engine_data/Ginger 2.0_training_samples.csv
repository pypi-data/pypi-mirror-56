"Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by an auto-immune reaction where the body’s own defence system attacks the cells that produce insulin. The reason for this condition is not quite clear. People with Type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority of people with diabetes. In this case, the body is resistant to the insulin it produces and/or the body cannot produce enough insulin. This leads to high blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is often, but not always, associated with being overweight or obese. Another reason for developing Type 2 diabetes could be a family history of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes consisting of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. GDM usually disappears after pregnancy, but women with GDM and their children are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes at a later stage. According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately half of the women with a history of GDM develop Type 2 diabetes within five to ten years after giving birth. Please consult your doctor for proper diabetic care.","How do I know if I have diabetes?"
"Instead of cream based sauces rather choose lower fat sauces without cream or butter. Tomato-based sauces are good choices. Always order sauces on the side, so that you can control how much you use. Instead of using oily sauces like mayonnaise and creamy salad dressings rather choose reduced-fat sauces like low-fat mayonnaise, olive oil based dressing, plain unsweetened yoghurt or tomato-based sauces. You can even try and mix mayonnaise with plain unsweetened yoghurt for a lighter option. Homemade is always best, make your own salad dressing to know that there are no unhealthy additives and excess sugar and salt.","Can I eat mayonnaise?"

"If you drink alcohol, drink in moderation. Women should not have more than 1 drink a day and men not more than 2 drinks a day. One drink is equal to a can of beer (340 ml) or a small glass of wine (120 ml) or a tot of spirits (25 ml). Water quenches your thirst far better than a drink. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not drink any alcohol at all, as it is very dangerous for the baby.","Can I drink beer, wine and spirits?"
"Remember the guideline of moderation when it comes to fat in our diet. It is more about the right type of fat than the quantity. Eat less fat from animal sources, like meat or cheese, and use the right type of fats or oils, from ingredients like eggs, fish, nuts, seeds and avocado. Eating too much fat and fried food can make you gain weight and raise your cholesterol.  * Always remove the visible fat from meat and the skin from chicken. * Drain off visible fat when cooking. Spoon out and throw away any leftover fat in the pan. * Allow soups, stews and mince dishes to cool down. Then spoon off the fat on top and throw it away. * When pan-frying or roasting meat, rather brush the meat with oil instead of pouring lots of oil in the pan. When preparing veggies, only use oil when really necessary and never deep-fry.","Can I eat fat?"

"Drink plenty of clean, safe water every day. You need about 6-8 glasses of water a day. Most of this should come from tap water, but can include drinks like tea, coffee or diluted fruit juice as well. Chilled water is sometimes easier to enjoy, than water straight from the tap, especially in summer. Invest in a water bottle that you can carry with you to see how much you’ve had during the day. Remember to avoid sugary drinks, like fizzy cool drinks, ready made iced tea, energy drinks, pre-flavoured water and undiluted fruit juice.","How much water should I drink?"

"Sugar is found naturally in some foods like fruits and dairy. However, during manufacturing extra sugar is added to many foods like sweetened cold drinks, sweets, biscuits and cakes, chocolates, some dairy products, and also many breakfast cereals. Too much sugar is not good for you as it adds unnecessary kilojoules (energy) which can lead to weight gain, being overweight or obese.

"A healthy breakfast helps to kick-start your energy levels, both for your body and your mind. It will help you stay alert and keep your concentration levels up until lunchtime and can even help to improve your memory. When you start eating a breakfast regularly, you may find that you eat less during the rest of the day so your energy levels are more constant. People who eat a regular breakfast are less likely to become overweight or to develop diseases such as heart disease or diabetes compared to people who often skip breakfast. Breakfast can become less healthy if we add too much sugar in the form of jams or sugar added at the table. Be aware of the sugar content of breakfast cereals, muesli, cereal biscuits and instant porridges. Many yoghurts also contain a lot of added sugar, avoid those that say 'sweetened'. Rather choose unsweetened options, like oats and plain yoghurt and add your own fresh fruit, nuts and seeds.","breakfast"
"Eating out can still be part of a healthier lifestyle if you choose your meals carefully. Instead of fried foods that are battered, crumbed, deep-fried, rather choose grilled, baked, roasted, steamed, blanched or boiled Remember that many takeaway and restaurant meals can be loaded with hidden fat, salt or sugar and the portions are often far too big. Instead of large, giant, mega, super-sized, jumbo portions rather order small, half, ladies, kiddies or order a starter instead of a main meal or share main meal. Fill your plate with salads and veggies on the side instead of fatty chips.","What can I order when I go out to eat?"

"Start with one step at a time and reduce your salt intake gradually. Gradual changes are easier to sustain and remember that you can teach your taste buds to enjoy food with less salt.

"Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by an auto-immune reaction where the body’s own defence system attacks the cells that produce insulin. The reason for this condition is not quite clear. People with Type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority of people with diabetes. In this case, the body is resistant to the insulin it produces and/or the body cannot produce enough insulin. This leads to high blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is often, but not always, associated with being overweight or obese. Another reason for developing Type 2 diabetes could be a family history of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes consisting of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. GDM usually disappears after pregnancy, but women with GDM and their children are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes at a later stage. According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately half of the women with a history of GDM develop Type 2 diabetes within five to ten years after giving birth.

"Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by an auto-immune reaction where the body’s own defence system attacks the cells that produce insulin. The reason for this condition is not quite clear. People with Type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority of people with diabetes. In this case, the body is resistant to the insulin it produces and/or the body cannot produce enough insulin. This leads to high blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes is often, but not always, associated with being overweight or obese. Another reason for developing Type 2 diabetes could be a family history of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes consisting of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. GDM usually disappears after pregnancy, but women with GDM and their children are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes at a later stage.

"Taking a lunch box to school or work can be much healthier than buying meals and unhealthy snacks every day. And the added bonus is that it's great for the budget too. Having a healthy lunch at hand helps to keep your concentration and energy levels up, enabling you and your children to tackle the demanding tasks we all face each day. Try to include the following for a balanced & healthy lunch box: * A lean, protein rich food – anything from tinned fish, a boiled egg, beans or lentils to lean meats, such as skinless chicken or trimmed beef. * Dairy – such as milk, unsweetened yoghurt or reduced fat cheese. * An unrefined starch – choose high-fibre or wholegrain starches, such as seed breads or wholewheat bread, wholewheat pitas or wraps, wholewheat crackers or wholewheat pasta. * Healthier nibbles, like fresh fruit and veggies, nuts and seeds.","Do you have any lunch box ideas?"
"Having healthy snacks available can tide you over to the next meal and avoid the temptation of unhealthy foods. Snacking on fresh fruit or veggies can be a great way to enjoy the recommended five portions a day of fruit and veg and help you get all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Other options are unsalted nuts or a trail mix, unsweetened yoghurts, vegetable sticks and hummus, or homemade popcorn. These are also perfect for lunch boxes. Healthy snacking does require a little planning to make sure you have them with you when you need them.","What snacks should I eat?"
