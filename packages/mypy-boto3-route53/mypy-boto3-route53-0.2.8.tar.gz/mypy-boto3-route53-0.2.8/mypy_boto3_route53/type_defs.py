    in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

       *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
       traffic:

        Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

      Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS CLI
      command `get-domain-names
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

      * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

      * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

      Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
      ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

        CloudFront distribution

      Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

      .. note::

        Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

        Elastic Beanstalk environment

      Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The environment
      must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the corresponding hosted zone
      IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in the
      "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        ELB load balancer

      Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods to
      get the hosted zone ID:

      * `Elastic Load Balancing
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the "AWS
      Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use the value
      that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note that there are
      separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for Network Load Balancers.

      * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
      navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone** field on
      the **Description** tab.

      * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable value.
      For more information, see the applicable guide:

        * Classic Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
        to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

        * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
        to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

      * **AWS CLI** : Use ``describe-load-balancers`` to get the applicable value. For more
      information, see the applicable guide:

        * Classic Load Balancers: Use `describe-load-balancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/describe-load-balancers.html>`__ to get
        the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

        * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `describe-load-balancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html>`__ to
        get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

        An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website

      Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more information
      about valid values, see the `Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ table in the "AWS
      Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

      Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't reference
      a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

    - **DNSName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

       *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want to
       route queries:

        Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

      Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using the
      AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

      * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

      * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the name
      of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

      .. note::

        The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API,
        such as ``api.example.com`` .

        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

      Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
      ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
      . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
      distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
      `describe-vpc-endpoints
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

        CloudFront distribution

      Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

      Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
      the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
      *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of
      the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

      You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
      CloudFront distribution.

      .. note::

        For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary
        and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
        name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you
        can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.

        Elastic Beanstalk environment

      If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
      deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
      environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com``
      is a regionalized domain name.

      .. warning::

        For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
        region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
        alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For
        example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
        acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
        routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

      For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the ``CNAME``
      attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
      attribute:

      * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console,
      see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
      Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

      * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of the
      ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__ in
      the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

      * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the ``CNAME``
      attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
      in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

        ELB load balancer

      Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the
      AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

      * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the navigation
      pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the value of the **DNS
      name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins
      with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value
      that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

      * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
      ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

        * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

        * Application and Network Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

      * **AWS CLI** : Use ``describe-load-balancers`` to get the value of ``DNSName`` . For more
      information, see the applicable guide:

        * Classic Load Balancers: `describe-load-balancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/describe-load-balancers.html>`__

        * Application and Network Load Balancers: `describe-load-balancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html>`__

        Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

      Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for
      example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid values, see
      the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
      Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see
      `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53

        Another Route 53 resource record set

      Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
      zone.

      .. note::

        If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
        zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of ``Type``
        is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
        you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
        even for an alias record.

    - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]**

       *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias
       resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias resource record
       set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or
       another resource record set in the hosted zone.

      Note the following:

        CloudFront distributions

      You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
      distribution.

        Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

      If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment contains an
      ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
      instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains
      an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set
      ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
      load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
      are healthy, if any.

      If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

        ELB load balancers

      Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

      * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName`` ,
      Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
      registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either
      no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
      to other resources.

      * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
      Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes queries to
      the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
      balancer:

        * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
        that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
        only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes
        queries to other resources.

        * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

      .. note::

        When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
        checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not
        create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
        balancer.

        S3 buckets

      There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the
      alias target is an S3 bucket.

        Other records in the same hosted zone

      If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
      example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
      associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information,
      see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?

    `GeoLocation`

     *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon Route
     53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if you
     want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of ``192.0.2.111``
     , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

    .. note::

      Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
      supported.

    If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one
    resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes
    to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one
    resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

    You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.

    The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
    specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
    and ``Type`` elements.

    .. warning::

      Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
      mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
      cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
      can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
      ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
      haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
      mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no
      answer" response for queries from those locations.

    You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
    and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

    Information about the resource record set to create, delete, or update.

    - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      For ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` requests, the name of the record that you want to create,
      update, or delete. For ``ListResourceRecordSets`` responses, the name of a record in the
      specified hosted zone.

       **ChangeResourceRecordSets Only**

      Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, ``www.example.com`` . You can optionally
      include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain
      name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats ``www.example.com``
      (without a trailing dot) and ``www.example.com.`` (with a trailing dot) as identical.

      For information about how to specify characters other than ``a-z`` , ``0-9`` , and ``-``
      (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see `DNS Domain Name Format
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name, for
      example, ``*.example.com`` . Note the following:

      * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify ``*prod.example.com`` or
      ``prod*.example.com`` .

      * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.

      * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats
      it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

      .. warning::

         You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS.

      You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example,
      ``*.example.com`` . You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example,
      ``marketing.*.example.com`` . In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example,
      you can't specify ``prod*.example.com`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The DNS record type. For information about different record types and how data is encoded for

      | ``NAPTR``
      | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

      .. note::

        SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
        However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value of
        ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of
        Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mechanism
        defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no
        longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see
        section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__
        .

      Values for alias resource record sets:

      * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

      * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two
      resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of ``A`` and one
      with a value of ``AAAA`` .

      * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

      * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

      * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

      * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

      * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource record
      set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS`` and ``SOA`` .

      .. note::

         If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
         zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of ``Type`` is
         ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record you're
         routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for
         an alias record.

    - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

       *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
       differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of name and
       type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com that have a type
       of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the value of
       ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

      For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **Weight** *(integer) --*

       *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
       combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that
       Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the
       sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name
       and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the
       total. Note the following:

      * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record set.

      * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

      * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same
      values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

      * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for
      the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

      * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0``
      for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for
      that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all resource record sets
      that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with
      equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to ``0`` is different when you associate
      health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see `Options for
      Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **Region** *(string) --*

       *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
       resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS resource,
       such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS
       domain name, depending on the record type.

      .. note::

        Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
        supported.

      When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
      created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that
      has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53
      then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

      Note the following:

      * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

      * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

      * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route
      53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you create latency
      resource record sets for.

      * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

    - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

       *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
       Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if
       you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
       ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a
       ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

      .. note::

        Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is
        not supported.

      If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example,
      one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
      goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent
      to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

      You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
      location.

      The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
      specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements.

      .. warning::

        Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
        mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
        cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
        can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
        ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
        haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
        mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a
        "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

      You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
      ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

      - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

        The two-letter code for the continent.

        Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

        Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or ``SubdivisionCode``
        returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

      - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

        The two-letter code for the country.

      - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

        The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United States.

    - **Failover** *(string) --*

       *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover`` element
       to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify ``PRIMARY`` as the
       value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you specify ``SECONDARY`` . In
       addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and specify the health check that you
       want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.

      Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
      ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

      * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
      applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
      secondary resource record set.

      * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is
      healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
      resource record set.

      * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
      the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
      primary resource record set.

      * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and if the
      primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the
      applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health
      of the associated endpoint.

      You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

      For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the ``EvaluateTargetHealth``
      element and set the value to true.

      For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

      * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

      * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

    - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

       *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly to
       multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each
       resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

      * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route
      53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is
      healthy.

      * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
      considers the record to be healthy.

      * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or
      fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.

      * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers
      with different combinations of healthy records.

      * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy
      records.

      * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
      typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

      You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

    - **TTL** *(integer) --*

      The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

      * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon Route 53
      uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

      * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
      ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or less so
      clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

      * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have the
      same value for ``TTL`` .

      * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource
      record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify
      a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that have the
      same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will change the
      effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

    - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

      Information about the resource records to act upon.

      .. note::

        If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

      - *(dict) --*

        Information specific to the resource record.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of a
          ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error is
          returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record types, see
          `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__ in
          the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and ``SOA`` .

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

    - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

       *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a CloudFront
       distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

      If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

      * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
      CloudFront distribution.

      * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in a
      private hosted zone is unsupported.

      * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone, see
      `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

         *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
         traffic:

          Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

        Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS CLI
        command `get-domain-names
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

        * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

        * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

          Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

        Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
        ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

          CloudFront distribution

        Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

        .. note::

          Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

          Elastic Beanstalk environment

        Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
        environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the corresponding
        hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in the
        "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          ELB load balancer

        Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods to
        get the hosted zone ID:

        * `Elastic Load Balancing
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the "AWS
        Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use the
        value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note that
        there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for Network Load
        Balancers.

        * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
        navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone** field on

          get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

          An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website

        Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more
        information about valid values, see the `Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ table in the "AWS
        Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

        Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
        reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

      - **DNSName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

         *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want to
         route queries:

          Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

        Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using the
        AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

        * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

        * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the
        name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

        .. note::

          The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API,
          such as ``api.example.com`` .

          Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

        Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
        ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
        . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
        distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
        `describe-vpc-endpoints
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

          CloudFront distribution

        Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

        Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
        the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
        *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of
        the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
        CloudFront distribution.

        .. note::

          For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
          primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that
          matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same
          name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.

          Elastic Beanstalk environment

        If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
        deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
        environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
        .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

        .. warning::

          For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
          region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of
          an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For
          example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic
          for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record
          that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

        For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the ``CNAME``
        attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the
        CNAME attribute:

        * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
        console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
        Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

        * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of the
        ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__ in
        the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

        * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the ``CNAME``
        attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
        in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

          ELB load balancer

        Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using
        the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

        * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
        navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the value
        of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the
        value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type of load
        balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

        * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
        ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

          * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html>`__

          Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

        Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in,
        for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid
        values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
        Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see
        `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

          Another Route 53 resource record set

        Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
        zone.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
          zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of ``Type``
          is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
          you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
          even for an alias record.

      - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]**

         *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted
         alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias resource
         record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer
         or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

        Note the following:

          CloudFront distributions

        You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
        distribution.

          Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

        If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment contains
        an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
        instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains
        an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set
        ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
        load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
        are healthy, if any.

        If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

          ELB load balancers

        Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

        * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName`` ,
        Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
        registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and
        either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53
        routes queries to other resources.

        * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
        Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes queries to
        the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
        balancer:

          * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
          that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group
          contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53
          routes queries to other resources.

          * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

        .. note::

          When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
          checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not
          create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
          balancer.

          S3 buckets

        There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the
        alias target is an S3 bucket.

          Other records in the same hosted zone

        If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
        example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
        associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information,
        see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

      If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only
      when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and
      specify the ID of the applicable health check.

      Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:

      * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check

      * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)

      * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

      .. warning::

        Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
        set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value`` element. When
        you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of
        the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

      For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

      * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

      * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

      * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

       **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

      Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
      or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
      choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
      the following configurations:

      * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
      resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
      weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
      all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is
      healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
      If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
      to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for
      all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record
      sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

      * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

        * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
        resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
        weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

        * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
        record set in the same hosted zone.

        * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

      If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be
      healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.

      If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
      alias resource record set.

      .. note::

        The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
        record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
        associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
        resource record sets.

       **Geolocation Routing**

      For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
      resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
      have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for
      North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which
      applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy,
      Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a
      resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

      * The United States

      * North America

      * The default resource record set

       **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

      If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a
      separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each ``HTTP``
      server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets (``www.example.com``
      ).

      .. warning::

        Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

        * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as the name
        of a resource record set.

        * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

    - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

      When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a resource
      record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route 53
      created this resource record set for.

      .. warning::

        To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
        ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
        automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` ,
        Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be
        charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

    """
    Type definition for `ClientChangeResourceRecordSetsChangeBatch` `Changes`

    The information for each resource record set that you want to change.

    - **Action** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The action to perform:

      * ``CREATE`` : Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.

      * ``DELETE`` : Deletes a existing resource record set.

      .. warning::

         To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
         `DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance
         <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance.html>`__
         . Amazon Route 53 will delete the resource record set automatically. If you delete the
         resource record set by using ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` , Route 53 doesn't automatically
         delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though
         it's no longer in use.

      * ``UPSERT`` : If a resource record set doesn't already exist, Route 53 creates it. If a
      resource record set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.

    - **ResourceRecordSet** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Information about the resource record set to create, delete, or update.

      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        For ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` requests, the name of the record that you want to create,
        update, or delete. For ``ListResourceRecordSets`` responses, the name of a record in the
        specified hosted zone.

         **ChangeResourceRecordSets Only**

        Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, ``www.example.com`` . You can optionally
        include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the
        domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats
        ``www.example.com`` (without a trailing dot) and ``www.example.com.`` (with a trailing dot)
        as identical.

        For information about how to specify characters other than ``a-z`` , ``0-9`` , and ``-``
        (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see `DNS Domain Name Format
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name, for
        example, ``*.example.com`` . Note the following:

        * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify ``*prod.example.com``
        or ``prod*.example.com`` .

        * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.

        * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS
        treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

        .. warning::

           You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS.

        You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example,
        ``*.example.com`` . You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example,
        ``marketing.*.example.com`` . In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example,
        you can't specify ``prod*.example.com`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        The DNS record type. For information about different record types and how data is encoded
        for them, see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__ in
        the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        Valid values for basic resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME``
        | ``MX``
        | ``NAPTR`` | ``NS`` | ``PTR`` | ``SOA`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

        Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: ``A`` |
        ``AAAA`` | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME`` | ``MX`` | ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV``
        | ``TXT``
        . When creating a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets,
        specify the same value for all of the resource record sets in the group.

        Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``MX`` |
        ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

        .. note::

          SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
          However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value
          of ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of
          Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mechanism
          defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no
          longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see
          section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type
          <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__ .

        Values for alias resource record sets:

        * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

        * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two
        resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of ``A`` and
        one with a value of ``AAAA`` .

        * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

        * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

        * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

        * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

        * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource
        record set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS`` and
        ``SOA`` .

        .. note::

           If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as
           the zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of ``Type`` is
           ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record you're
           routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even
           for an alias record.

      - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

         *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
         differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of name
         and type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com that have a
         type of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the value
         of ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

        For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **Weight** *(integer) --*

         *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
         combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries
         that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates
         the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS
         name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight
         to the total. Note the following:

        * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record
        set.

        * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

        * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same
        values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

        * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values
        for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

        * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0``
        for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for
        that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all resource record
        sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources
        with equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to ``0`` is different when you
        associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see
        `Options for Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **Region** *(string) --*

         *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
         resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS
         resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP
         address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.

        .. note::

          Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
          supported.

        When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
        created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that
        has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53
        then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

        Note the following:

        * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

        * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

        * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions.
        Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you create
        latency resource record sets for.

        * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the
        ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

      - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

         *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
         Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example,
         if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
         ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a
         ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

        .. note::

          Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is
          not supported.

        If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example,
        one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent),
        priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a
        continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a
        different resource.

        You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
        location.

        The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
        specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
        ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

        .. warning::

          Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
          mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets
          that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations
          that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the
          value of ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations
          for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP
          addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record
          set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

        You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
        ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

        - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

          The two-letter code for the continent.

          Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

          Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or
          ``SubdivisionCode`` returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

        - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

          The two-letter code for the country.

        - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

          The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United
          States.

      - **Failover** *(string) --*

         *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover``
         element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify ``PRIMARY``
         as the value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you specify
         ``SECONDARY`` . In addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and specify the
         health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.

        Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
        ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

        * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
        applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
        secondary resource record set.

        * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is
        healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
        resource record set.

        * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
        the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
        primary resource record set.

        * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and if
        the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with
        the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the
        health of the associated endpoint.

        You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the
        ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

        For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the ``EvaluateTargetHealth``
        element and set the value to true.

        For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics in
        the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

        * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

        * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

      - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

         *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly to
         multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each
         resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

        * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route
        53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is
        healthy.

        * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
        considers the record to be healthy.

        * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or
        fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.

        * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers
        with different combinations of healthy records.

        * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight
        unhealthy records.

        * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
        typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

        You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

      - **TTL** *(integer) --*

        The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

        * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon Route
        53 uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

        * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
        ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or less so
        clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

        * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have the
        same value for ``TTL`` .

        * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource
        record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you
        specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that
        have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will
        change the effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

      - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

        Information about the resource records to act upon.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

        - *(dict) --*

          Information specific to the resource record.

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

          - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of a
            ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error is
            returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record types, see
            `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and ``SOA`` .

            .. note::

              If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

      - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

         *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a CloudFront
         distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

        If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

        * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to
        a CloudFront distribution.

        * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in a
        private hosted zone is unsupported.

        * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone, see
        `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

           *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
           traffic:

            Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

          Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS
          CLI command `get-domain-names
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

          * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

          * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

            Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

          Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
          ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

            CloudFront distribution

          Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

          .. note::

            Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

            Elastic Beanstalk environment

          Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
          environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the
          corresponding hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in
          the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

            ELB load balancer

          Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods
          to get the hosted zone ID:

          * `Elastic Load Balancing
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the "AWS
          Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use the
          value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note that
          there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for Network Load
          Balancers.

          * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
          navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone** field
          on the **Description** tab.

          * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable
          value. For more information, see the applicable guide:

            * Classic Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
            to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

            * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
            to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

            Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

          Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
          reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

        - **DNSName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

           *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want
           to route queries:

            Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

          Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using
          the AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

          * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

          * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the
          name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

          .. note::

            The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your
            API, such as ``api.example.com`` .

            Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

          Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
          ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
          . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
          distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
          `describe-vpc-endpoints
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

            CloudFront distribution

          Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

          Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name
          of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
          *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one
          of the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names
          (CNAMEs)
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

          You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
          CloudFront distribution.

          .. note::

            For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
            primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that
            matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same
            name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one
            distribution.

            Elastic Beanstalk environment

          If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
          deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
          environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
          .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

          .. warning::

            For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include
            the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record
            instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root
            domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record
            that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you
            can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk
            environment.

          For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the
          ``CNAME`` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the
          value of the CNAME attribute:

          * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
          console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
          Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

          * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of
          the ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__
          in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

          * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the ``CNAME``
          attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
          in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

            ELB load balancer

          Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using
          the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

          * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
          navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the
          value of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer,
          get the value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type
          of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

          * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
          ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

            * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers

            Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

          Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in,
          for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid
          values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
          Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites,
          see `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

            Another Route 53 resource record set

          Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
          zone.

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as
            the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of
            ``Type`` is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the
            record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex
            isn't supported even for an alias record.

        - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]**

           *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted
           alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias
           resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB
           load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

          Note the following:

            CloudFront distributions

          You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
          distribution.

            Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

          If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment
          contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy
          Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment
          automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2
          instance.) If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2
          instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to
          other available resources that are healthy, if any.

          If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
          requirements.

            ELB load balancers

          Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

          * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName``
          , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
          registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and
          either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53
          routes queries to other resources.

          * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or
          Network Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes
          queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated
          with the load balancer:

            * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target
            group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target
            group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and
            Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

            * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

          .. note::

            When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing
            health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function.
            Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB
            load balancer.

            S3 buckets

          There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when
          the alias target is an S3 bucket.

            Other records in the same hosted zone

          If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
          example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that
          you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more
          information, see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

        If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query
        only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and
        specify the ID of the applicable health check.

        Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:

        * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check

        * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)

        * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

        .. warning::

          Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
          set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value`` element. When
          you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health
          of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

        For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

        * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

        * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

        * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

         **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

        Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between
        two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base
        the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense
        only in the following configurations:

        * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
        resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
        weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs
        for all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is
        healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
        with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
        responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check
        status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all
        resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

        * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

          * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
          resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
          weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

          * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
          record set in the same hosted zone.

          * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

        If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
        be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
        with.

        If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
        alias resource record set.

        .. note::

          The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
          record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
          associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
          resource record sets.

         **Geolocation Routing**

        For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
        resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
        have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States,
        for North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` ,
        which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
        unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it
        finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

        * The United States

        * North America

        * The default resource record set

         **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

        If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create
        a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
        ``HTTP`` server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
        ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets
        (``www.example.com`` ).

        .. warning::

          Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

          * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as the
          name of a resource record set.

          * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

        When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a resource
        record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route
        53 created this resource record set for.

        .. warning::

          To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
          ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
          automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using ``ChangeResourceRecordSets``
          , Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue
          to be charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

            Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, ``www.example.com`` . You can
            optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes
            that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53

            trailing dot) as identical.

            the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name,
            for example, ``*.example.com`` . Note the following:

            * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify
            ``*prod.example.com`` or ``prod*.example.com`` .

            * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.

            * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS
            treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

            example, you can't specify ``prod*.example.com`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The DNS record type. For information about different record types and how data is
            encoded for them, see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            Valid values for basic resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``CAA``
            | ``CNAME`` |
            ``MX`` | ``NAPTR`` | ``NS`` | ``PTR`` | ``SOA`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

            Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: ``A``
            |
            ``AAAA`` | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME`` | ``MX`` | ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF``
            | ``SRV`` |
            ``TXT`` . When creating a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource
            record sets, specify the same value for all of the resource record sets in the group.

            Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA``
            | ``MX`` |
            ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

            .. note::

              SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
              However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the
              value of ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for
              Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts
              existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues.
              Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are
              not to use it." In RFC 7208, see section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type
              <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__ .

            Values for alias resource record sets:

            * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

            * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create
            two resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of
            ``A`` and one with a value of ``AAAA`` .

            * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

            * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

            * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

            * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

            * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource
            record set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS``
            and ``SOA`` .

            .. note::

               If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known
               as the zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of
               ``Type`` is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as
               the record you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex
               isn't supported even for an alias record.

          - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

             *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
             differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of
             name and type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com
             that have a type of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and
             type, the value of ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

            For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in
            the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **Weight** *(integer) --*

             *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
             combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries
             that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53
             calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same
             combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio
             of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:

            * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record
            set.

            * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

            * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the
            same values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

            * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same
            values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

            * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to
            ``0`` for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable
            value for that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all
            resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is
            routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to
            ``0`` is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.
            For more information, see `Options for Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and
            Active-Passive Failover
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **Region** *(string) --*

             *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
             resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS
             resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP
             address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.

            .. note::

              Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
              supported.

            When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
            created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set
            that has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region.
            Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record
            set.

            Note the following:

            * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

            * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

            * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions.
            Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you
            create latency resource record sets for.

            * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the
            ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

          - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

             *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how
             Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query.
             For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an
             IP address of ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A``
             and a ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

            .. note::

              Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted
              zones is not supported.

            If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for
            example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same
            continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route
            most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that
            continent to a different resource.

            You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
            location.

            The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that
            aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for
            the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

            .. warning::

              Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses
              aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource
              record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries
              from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record
              set for which the value of ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that
              come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and
              queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a
              ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from
              those locations.

            You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
            ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

            - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

              The two-letter code for the continent.

              Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

              Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or
              ``SubdivisionCode`` returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

            - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

              The two-letter code for the country.

            - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

              The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United
              States.

          - **Failover** *(string) --*

             *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover``
             element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify
             ``PRIMARY`` as the value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you
             specify ``SECONDARY`` . In addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and
             specify the health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource
             record set.

            Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
            ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

            * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
            the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of
            the secondary resource record set.

            * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record
            set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the
            secondary resource record set.

            * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
            with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health
            of the primary resource record set.

            * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and
            if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries
            with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true
            regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.

            You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the
            ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

            For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the
            ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` element and set the value to true.

            For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

            * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

            * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

          - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

             *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly
             to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for
             each resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

            * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon
            Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health
            check is healthy.

            * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
            considers the record to be healthy.

            * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight
            or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy
            records.

            * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS
            resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.

            * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight
            unhealthy records.

            * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
            typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

            You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

          - **TTL** *(integer) --*

            The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

            * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon
            Route 53 uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

            * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
            ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or
            less so clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

            * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have
            the same value for ``TTL`` .

            * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias
            resource record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend
            that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource
            record sets that have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for
            load balancers) will change the effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

          - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

            Information about the resource records to act upon.

            .. note::

              If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

            - *(dict) --*

              Information specific to the resource record.

              .. note::

                If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

              - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of
                a ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error
                is returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record
                types, see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__
                in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and
                ``SOA`` .

                .. note::

                  If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

          - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

             *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a
             CloudFront distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

            If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

            * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route
            traffic to a CloudFront distribution.

            * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets
            in a private hosted zone is unsupported.

            * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone,
            see `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

               *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to
               route traffic:

                Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

              Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the
              AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__
              :

              * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

              * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

                Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

              Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
              ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__
              .

                CloudFront distribution

              Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

              .. note::

                Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

                Elastic Beanstalk environment

              Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
              environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the
              corresponding hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__
              in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General
              Reference* .

                ELB load balancer

              Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following
              methods to get the hosted zone ID:

              * `Elastic Load Balancing
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the
              "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* :
              Use the value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in.
              Note that there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and
              for Network Load Balancers.

              * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in
              the navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted
              zone** field on the **Description** tab.

              * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable
              value. For more information, see the applicable guide:

                * Classic Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
                to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

                * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
                to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

              * **AWS CLI** : Use ``describe-load-balancers`` to get the applicable value. For more

                Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

              Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
              reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

            - **DNSName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

               *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you
               want to route queries:

                Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

              Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value
              using the AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__
              :

              * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

              * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is
              the name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as
              ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

              .. note::

                The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your
                API, such as ``api.example.com`` .

                Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

              Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
              ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
              . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
              distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
              `describe-vpc-endpoints
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__
              .

                CloudFront distribution

              Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

              Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
              name of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set
              is *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com*
              as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate
              Domain Names (CNAMEs)
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in
              the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

              You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
              CloudFront distribution.

              .. note::

                For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
                primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name
                that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
                the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one
                distribution.

                Elastic Beanstalk environment

              If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
              deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
              environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
              .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

              .. warning::

                For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't
                include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME
                record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the
                root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a
                record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk
                environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to
                your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

              For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the
              ``CNAME`` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the
              value of the CNAME attribute:

              * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
              console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the
              *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

              * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value
              of the ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__
              in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

              * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the
              ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
              in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

                ELB load balancer

              Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by
              using the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

              * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
              navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the
              value of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load
              Balancer, get the value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to
              another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or
              AAAA.

              * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
              ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

                * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

              * **AWS CLI** : Use ``describe-load-balancers`` to get the value of ``DNSName`` . For
              more information, see the applicable guide:

                * Classic Load Balancers: `describe-load-balancers

                Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

              Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket
              in, for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about
              valid values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon
              Web Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for
              websites, see `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in
              the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

                Another Route 53 resource record set

              Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current
              hosted zone.

              .. note::

                If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known
                as the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the
                value of ``Type`` is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same
                type as the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for
                the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.

            - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]**

               *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and
               weighted alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an
               alias resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as
               an ELB load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

              Note the following:

                CloudFront distributions

              You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a
              CloudFront distribution.

                Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

              If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment
              contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the
              healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An
              environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one
              Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no
              Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53
              routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.

              If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
              requirements.

                ELB load balancers

              Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

              * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in
              ``DNSName`` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
              instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set
              ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the
              load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

              * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or
              Network Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53
              routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
              associated with the load balancer:

                * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target
                group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target
                group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy,
                and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

                * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

              .. note::

                When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing
                health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar
                function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you
                register with an ELB load balancer.

                S3 buckets

              There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true``
              when the alias target is an S3 bucket.

                Other records in the same hosted zone

              If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records
              (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we
              recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias
              target. For more information, see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__
              in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
              *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

            If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS
            query only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId``
            element and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

            Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the
            following:

            * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health
            check

            * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health
            checks)

            * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health
            checks)

            .. warning::

              Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource
              record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value``
              element. When you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53
              checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

            For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*
            :

            * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

            * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

            * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

             **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

            Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing
            between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route
            53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks
            makes sense only in the following configurations:

            * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of
            non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such
            as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify
            health check IDs for all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a
            resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it
            responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is
            unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource
            record set. If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is
            unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds
            to DNS queries accordingly.

            * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

              * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group
              of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as
              multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

              * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
              record set in the same hosted zone.

              * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

            If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set
            to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS
            queries with.

            If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using
            the alias resource record set.

            .. note::

              The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias
              resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that
              configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the
              group of non-alias resource record sets.

             **Geolocation Routing**

            For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
            resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose
            you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United
            States, for North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode``
            is ``*`` , which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record
            set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following
            order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

            * The United States

            * North America

            * The default resource record set

             **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

            If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you
            create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
            each ``HTTP`` server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
            ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets
            (``www.example.com`` ).

            .. warning::

              Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

              * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as
              the name of a resource record set.

              * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

          - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

            When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a
            resource record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy
            instance that Route 53 created this resource record set for.

            .. warning::

              To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance,
              use ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
              automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using
              ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` , Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic
              policy instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though it's no longer
              in use.

    Type definition for `ClientCreateHealthCheck` `HealthCheckConfig`

    A complex type that contains settings for a new health check.

    - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

      The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
      checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
      resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that
      you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks
      the health of the endpoint.

      Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

      * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
      ``192.0.2.44`` .

      * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
      example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as
      described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

      If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
      associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
      This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

      For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
      .

      Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
      local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
      which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

      * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

      * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

      * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Port** *(integer) --*

      The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a
      value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
      determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

      You can create the following types of health checks:

      * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      .. warning::

         If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or
         later.

      * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
      that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
      string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

      * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
      of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ``ALARM`` ,
      the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to
      determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends on the
      setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
      ``LastKnownStatus`` .

      * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
      adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
      compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

      The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
      path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
      when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can
      also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

    - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

      Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

       **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

      Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
      the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks except
      TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
      want Route 53 to perform health checks.

      When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host`` header:

      * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      Host header.

      * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      ``Host`` header.

      * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , Route
      53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

      If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the value
      of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

       **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

      Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
      at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
      returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

      .. note::

        If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
        checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that
        you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
        failed" error.

      If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you
      choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that you
      create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
      HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

      .. warning::

        In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
        associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
        unpredictable.

      In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
      ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
      ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host`` header.

    - **SearchString** *(string) --*

      If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
      Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string
      appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

      Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

    - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

      The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint
      and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes
      requests at this interval.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

      If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53
      to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
      information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
      checks.

    - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
      multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
      **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

    - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example,
      to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

    - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

      Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
      happens:

      * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to
      your application, server, or other resource.

      * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health
      checks.

      * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
      corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

      After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always
      be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
      corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value
      of `Inverted
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
      .

      Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
      information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

    - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check that
      Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be considered
      healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED``
      health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
      element.

      Note the following:

      * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
      considers this health check to be unhealthy.

      * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

    - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

      (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck`` element
      for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

      - *(string) --*

    - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to
      the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint
      to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

      Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
      message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
      handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
      enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
      and confirm that your certificate is valid.

      The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
      and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain names
      in the certificate should match the value that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` .
      If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with a certificate that does not
      include the domain name that you specified in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker
      will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello`` message.

    - **Regions** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want Amazon
      Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

      If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from
      all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

      If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route
      53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
      checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four
      different regions).

      - *(string) --*

    - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
      checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

      - **Region** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

    - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

      When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
      status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

      * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

      * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

      CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
      no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

):
    """
    Type definition for `ClientCreateHealthCheckResponseHealthCheck` `HealthCheckConfig`

    A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

    - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

      The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
      checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
      resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that
      you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks
      the health of the endpoint.

      Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

      * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
      ``192.0.2.44`` .

      * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
      example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as
      described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

      If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
      associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
      This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

      For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
      .

      Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
      local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
      which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

      * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

      * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

      * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Port** *(integer) --*

      The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a
      value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
      determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

      You can create the following types of health checks:

      * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      .. warning::

         If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or
         later.

      * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
      that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
      string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

      * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
      of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ``ALARM`` ,
      the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to
      determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends on the
      setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
      ``LastKnownStatus`` .

      * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
      adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
      compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

      The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
      path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
      when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can
      also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

    - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

      Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

       **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

      Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
      the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks except
      TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
      want Route 53 to perform health checks.

      When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host`` header:

      * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      Host header.

      * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      ``Host`` header.

      * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , Route
      53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

      If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the value
      of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

       **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

      Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
      at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
      returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

      .. note::

        If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
        checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that
        you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
        failed" error.

      If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you
      choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that you
      create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
      HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

      .. warning::

        In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
        associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
        unpredictable.

      In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
      ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
      ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host`` header.

    - **SearchString** *(string) --*

      If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
      Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string
      appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

      Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

    - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

      The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint
      and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes
      requests at this interval.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

      If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53
      to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
      information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
      checks.

    - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
      multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
      **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

    - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example,
      to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

    - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

      Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
      happens:

      * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to
      your application, server, or other resource.

      * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health
      checks.

      * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
      corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

      After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always
      be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
      corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value
      of `Inverted
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
      .

      Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
      information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

    - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check that
      Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be considered
      healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED``
      health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
      element.

      Note the following:

      * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
      considers this health check to be unhealthy.

      * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

    - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

      (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck`` element
      for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

      - *(string) --*

    - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to
      the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint
      to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

      Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
      message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
      handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
      enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
      and confirm that your certificate is valid.

      The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
      and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain names
      in the certificate should match the value that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` .
      If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with a certificate that does not
      include the domain name that you specified in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker
      will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello`` message.

    - **Regions** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want Amazon
      Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

      If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from
      all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

      If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route
      53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
      checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four
      different regions).

      - *(string) --*

    - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
      checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

      - **Region** *(string) --*

        For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether
        this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

    - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

      When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
      status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

      * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

      * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

      * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
      CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
      no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

      - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

        The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
        checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
        resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval
        that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then
        checks the health of the endpoint.

        Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

        * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
        ``192.0.2.44`` .

        * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
        example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
        as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

        If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
        associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
        This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

        For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
        .

        Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
        local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
        for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

        * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

        * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

        * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Port** *(integer) --*

        The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify
        a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --*

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
        determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

        You can create the following types of health checks:

        * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        .. warning::

           If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
           or later.

        * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
        submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
        string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
        53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for
        the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

        * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
        state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
        ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient
        data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends
        on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
        ``LastKnownStatus`` .

        * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
        53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
        and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

        For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

        The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
        The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
        3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You
        can also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=
            jp&login=y``
        .

      - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

        Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

         **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

        Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
        the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks
        except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
        which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

        When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
        header:

        * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        Host header.

        * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        ``Host`` header.

        * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
        Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

        If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
        value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

         **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

        Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
        returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

        .. note::

          If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
          checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
          that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
          resolution failed" error.

        If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
        you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that
        you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
        each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
        us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

        .. warning::

          In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
          associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
          unpredictable.

        In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
        ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
        ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
        header.

      - **SearchString** *(string) --*

        If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
        Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the
        string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

        Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

      - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

        The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
        endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
        checker makes requests at this interval.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

        If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route
        53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For
        more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
        checks.

      - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
        multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
        **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

      - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
        example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

      - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

        Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
        happens:

        * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
        to your application, server, or other resource.

        * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
        health checks.

        * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
        corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

        After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
        always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
        the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
        value of `Inverted
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
        .

        Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
        information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

      - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
        that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
        considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
        ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
        element.

        Note the following:

        * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
        considers this health check to be unhealthy.

        * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

      - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

        (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
        element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

        - *(string) --*

      - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
        endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
        certificate.

        Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
        message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
        handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
        enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
        and confirm that your certificate is valid.

        The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
        and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain
        names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with
        a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
        attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello``
        message.

      - **Regions** *(list) --*

        A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
        Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

        If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
        from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

        If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
        Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
        checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with
        four different regions).

        - *(string) --*

      - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
        checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

        - **Region** *(string) --*

          For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
          whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

          For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
          and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        - **Name** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
          determine whether this health check is healthy.

          .. note::

            Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

            * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
            information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
            aren't supported.

      - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

        When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
        status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

        * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

        * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

        * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
        CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
        no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

      The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
      ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

    - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
      monitoring for this health check.

      - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that the
        metric is compared to the threshold.

      - **Threshold** *(float) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
        compared with.

      - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
        is used for the comparison.

      - **Period** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one evaluation
        period in seconds.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

      - **Namespace** *(string) --*

        The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see

      - **Statistic** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is applied
        to the metric.

      - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that contains
        information about the dimensions for the metric. For information, see `Amazon CloudWatch

      - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

        - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

          The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform
          health checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS
          request to resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the
          interval that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS,
          Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

          * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
          ``192.0.2.44`` .

          * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
          example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
          as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

          If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
          associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress``
          . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress``
          .

        - **Port** *(integer) --*

          The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
          Specify a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

        - **Type** *(string) --*

          The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
          determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

          You can create the following types of health checks:

          * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
          an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

          * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
          submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than
          400.

          .. warning::

             If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
             or later.

          * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
          53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
          string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

          * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
          53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body
          for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

          * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

          * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
          state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
          ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
          sufficient data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check
          status depends on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` ,
          ``Unhealthy`` , or ``LastKnownStatus`` .

          * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
          53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be
          healthy and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

          For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

          The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
          The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx
          or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file
          /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also include query string parameters, for
          example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

        - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

          Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

           **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

          Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
          passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health
          checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the
          endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

          When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
          header:

          * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
          ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
          the Host header.

          * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
          ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
          the ``Host`` header.

          * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
          Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

          If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
          value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

           **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

          Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` .
          Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          .. note::

            If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
            checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
            that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
            resolution failed" error.

          If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
          you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend
          that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health
          check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
          us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

          .. warning::

            In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
            associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
            unpredictable.

          In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
          ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value
          for ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
          header.

        - **SearchString** *(string) --*

          If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you
          want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If
          the string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

          Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

        - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

          The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
          endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
          checker makes requests at this interval.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

          If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30``
          seconds.

        - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

          The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon
          Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
          versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
          Healthy
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
          checks.

        - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
          multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
          **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

        - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
          example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered
          healthy.

        - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

          Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
          happens:

          * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
          to your application, server, or other resource.

          * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
          health checks.

          * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
          corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

          After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
          always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
          the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
          value of `Inverted
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
          .

          Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
          information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

        - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

          The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
          that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
          considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
          ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
          element.

          Note the following:

          * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
          considers this health check to be unhealthy.

          * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

        - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

          (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
          element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health
          check.

          - *(string) --*

        - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
          to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
          endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
          certificate.

          Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the
          ``client_hello`` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be
          ``SSL alert handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other
          reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS
          configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

          The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name``
          field and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the
          domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message
          with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
          attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the
          ``client_hello`` message.

        - **Regions** *(list) --*

          A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
          Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

          If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
          from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

          If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
          Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some
          health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
          regions with four different regions).

          - *(string) --*

        - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
          checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

          - **Region** *(string) --*

            For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
            whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

            For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS
            Regions and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          - **Name** *(string) --*

            The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
            determine whether this health check is healthy.

            .. note::

              Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

              * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
              information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
              in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

              * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
              aren't supported.

        - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

          When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
          status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

          * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

          * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

          * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time
          that CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks
          that have no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

      - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

        The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
        ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

      - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
        monitoring for this health check.

        - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that
          the metric is compared to the threshold.

        - **Threshold** *(float) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
          compared with.

        - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
          is used for the comparison.

        - **Period** *(integer) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one
          evaluation period in seconds.

):
    """
    Type definition for `ClientGetHealthCheckResponseHealthCheck` `HealthCheckConfig`

    A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

    - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

      The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
      checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
      resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that
      you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks
      the health of the endpoint.

      Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

      * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
      ``192.0.2.44`` .

      * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
      example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as
      described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

      If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
      associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
      This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

      For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
      .

      Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
      local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
      which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

      * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

      * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

      * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Port** *(integer) --*

      The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a
      value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
      determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

      You can create the following types of health checks:

      * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      .. warning::

         If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or
         later.

      * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
      that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
      string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

      * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
      of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ``ALARM`` ,
      the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to
      determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends on the
      setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
      ``LastKnownStatus`` .

      * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
      adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
      compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

      The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
      path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
      when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can
      also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

    - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

      Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

       **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

      Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
      the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks except
      TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
      want Route 53 to perform health checks.

      When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host`` header:

      * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      Host header.

      * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      ``Host`` header.

      * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , Route
      53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

      If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the value
      of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

       **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

      Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
      at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
      returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

      .. note::

        If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
        checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that
        you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
        failed" error.

      If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you
      choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that you
      create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
      HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

      .. warning::

        In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
        associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
        unpredictable.

      In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
      ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
      ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host`` header.

    - **SearchString** *(string) --*

      If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
      Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string
      appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

      Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

    - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

      The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint
      and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes
      requests at this interval.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

      If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53
      to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
      information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
      checks.

    - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
      multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
      **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

    - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example,
      to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

    - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

      Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
      happens:

      * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to
      your application, server, or other resource.

      * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health
      checks.

      * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
      corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

      After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always
      be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
      corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value
      of `Inverted
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
      .

      Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
      information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

    - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check that
      Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be considered
      healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED``
      health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
      element.

      Note the following:

      * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
      considers this health check to be unhealthy.

      * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

    - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

      (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck`` element
      for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

      - *(string) --*

    - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to
      the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint
      to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

      Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
      message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
      handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
      enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
      and confirm that your certificate is valid.

      The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
      and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain names
      in the certificate should match the value that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` .
      If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with a certificate that does not
      include the domain name that you specified in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker
      will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello`` message.

    - **Regions** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want Amazon
      Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

      If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from
      all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

      If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route
      53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
      checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four
      different regions).

      - *(string) --*

    - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
      checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

      - **Region** *(string) --*

        For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether
        this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

        For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch

        The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
        determine whether this health check is healthy.

        .. note::

          Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

          * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
          information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__

          * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics aren't
          supported.

    - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

      When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
      status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

      * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

      * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

      * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
      CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
      no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    Type definition for `ClientGetHealthCheckResponse` `HealthCheck`

    A complex type that contains information about one health check that is associated with the
    current AWS account.

    - **Id** *(string) --*

      The identifier that Amazon Route 53assigned to the health check when you created it. When you

      A unique string that you specified when you created the health check.

    - **LinkedService** *(dict) --*

      If the health check was created by another service, the service that created the health check.
      When a health check is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon

        you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

    - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

      - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

        The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
        checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
        resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval
        that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then
        checks the health of the endpoint.

        Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

        * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
        ``192.0.2.44`` .

        * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
        example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
        as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

        If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
        associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
        This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

        For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
        .

        Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
        local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
        for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

        * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

        * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

        * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Port** *(integer) --*

        The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify
        a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --*

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
        determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

        You can create the following types of health checks:

        * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        .. warning::

           If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
           or later.

        * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
        submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
        string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
        53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for
        the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

        * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
        state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
        ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient
        data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends
        on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
        ``LastKnownStatus`` .

        * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
        53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
        and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

        For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

        The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
        The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
        3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You
        can also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=
            jp&login=y``
        .

      - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

        Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

         **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

        Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
        the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks
        except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
        which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

        When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
        header:

        * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        Host header.

        * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        ``Host`` header.

        * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
        Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

        If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
        value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

         **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

        Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
        returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

        .. note::

          If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
          checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
          that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
          resolution failed" error.

        If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
        you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that
        you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
        each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
        us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

        .. warning::

          In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
          associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
          unpredictable.

        In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
        ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
        ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
        header.

      - **SearchString** *(string) --*

        If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
        Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the
        string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

        Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

      - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

        The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
        endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
        checker makes requests at this interval.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

        If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route
        53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For
        more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
        checks.

      - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
        multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
        **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

      - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
        example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

      - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

        Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
        happens:

        * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
        to your application, server, or other resource.

        * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
        health checks.

        * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
        corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

        After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
        always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
        the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
        value of `Inverted
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
        .

        Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
        information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

      - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
        that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
        considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
        ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
        element.

        Note the following:

        * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
        considers this health check to be unhealthy.

        * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

      - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

        (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
        element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

        - *(string) --*

      - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
        endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
        certificate.

        Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
        message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
        handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
        enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
        and confirm that your certificate is valid.

        The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
        and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain
        names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with
        a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
        attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello``
        message.

      - **Regions** *(list) --*

        A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
        Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

        If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
        from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

        If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
        Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
        checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with
        four different regions).

        - *(string) --*

      - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
        checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

        - **Region** *(string) --*

          For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
          whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

          For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
          and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        - **Name** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
          determine whether this health check is healthy.

          .. note::

            Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

            * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
            information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
            aren't supported.

      - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

        When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
        status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

        * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

        * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

        * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
        CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
        no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

      The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
      ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

    - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
      monitoring for this health check.

      - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that the
        metric is compared to the threshold.

      - **Threshold** *(float) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
        compared with.

      - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
        is used for the comparison.

      - **Period** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one evaluation
        period in seconds.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

      - **Namespace** *(string) --*

        The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see

    """
    Type definition for `ClientGetHealthCheck` `Response`

    A complex type that contains the response to a ``GetHealthCheck`` request.

    - **HealthCheck** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains information about one health check that is associated with the
      current AWS account.

      - **Id** *(string) --*

        The identifier that Amazon Route 53assigned to the health check when you created it. When
        you add or update a resource record set, you use this value to specify which health check to
        use. The value can be up to 64 characters long.

      - **CallerReference** *(string) --*

        A unique string that you specified when you created the health check.

      - **LinkedService** *(dict) --*

        If the health check was created by another service, the service that created the health
        check. When a health check is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it using
        Amazon Route 53.

        - **ServicePrincipal** *(string) --*

          If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, the service that
          created the resource. When a resource is created by another service, you can't edit or
          delete it using Amazon Route 53.

        - **Description** *(string) --*

          If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, an optional description
          that can be provided by the other service. When a resource is created by another service,
          you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

      - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

        - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

          The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform
          health checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS
          request to resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the
          interval that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS,
          Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

          * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
          ``192.0.2.44`` .

          * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
          example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
          as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

          If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
          associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress``
          . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

          For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
          .

          Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
          local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
          for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

          * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

          * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
          <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

          * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress``
          .

        - **Port** *(integer) --*

          The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
          Specify a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

        - **Type** *(string) --*

          The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
          determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

          You can create the following types of health checks:

          * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
          an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

          * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
          submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than
          400.

          .. warning::

             If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
             or later.

          * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
          53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
          string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

          * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
          53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body
          for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

          * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

          * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
          state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
          ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
          sufficient data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check
          status depends on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` ,
          ``Unhealthy`` , or ``LastKnownStatus`` .

          * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
          53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be
          healthy and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

          For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

          The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
          The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx
          or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file
          /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also include query string parameters, for
          example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

        - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

          Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

           **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

          Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
          passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health
          checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the
          endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

          When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
          header:

          * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
          ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
          the Host header.

          * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
          ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
          the ``Host`` header.

          * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
          Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

          If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
          value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

           **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

          Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` .
          Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          .. note::

            If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
            checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
            that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
            resolution failed" error.

          If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
          you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend
          that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health
          check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
          us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

          .. warning::

            In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
            associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
            unpredictable.

          In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
          ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value
          for ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
          header.

        - **SearchString** *(string) --*

          If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you
          want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If
          the string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

          Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

        - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

          The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
          endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
          checker makes requests at this interval.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

          If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30``
          seconds.

        - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

          The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon
          Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
          versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
          Healthy
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
          checks.

        - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
          multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
          **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

        - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
          example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered
          healthy.

        - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

          Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
          happens:

          * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
          to your application, server, or other resource.

          * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
          health checks.

          * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
          corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

          After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
          always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
          the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
          value of `Inverted
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
          .

          Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
          information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

        - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

          The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
          that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
          considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
          ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
          element.

          Note the following:

          * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
          considers this health check to be unhealthy.

          * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

        - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

          (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
          element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health
          check.

          - *(string) --*

        - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
          to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
          endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
          certificate.

          Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the
          ``client_hello`` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be
          ``SSL alert handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other
          reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS
          configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

          The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name``
          field and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the
          domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message
          with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
          attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the
          ``client_hello`` message.

        - **Regions** *(list) --*

          A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
          Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

          If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
          from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

          If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
          Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some
          health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
          regions with four different regions).

          - *(string) --*

        - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
          checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

          - **Region** *(string) --*

            For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
            whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

            For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS
            Regions and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          - **Name** *(string) --*

            The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
            determine whether this health check is healthy.

            .. note::

              Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

              * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
              information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
              in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

              * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
              aren't supported.

        - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

          When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
          status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

          * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

          * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

          * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time
          that CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks
          that have no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

      - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

        The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
        ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

      - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
        monitoring for this health check.

        - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that
          the metric is compared to the threshold.

        - **Threshold** *(float) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
          compared with.

        - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
          is used for the comparison.

        - **Period** *(integer) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one
          evaluation period in seconds.

        - **MetricName** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

        - **Namespace** *(string) --*

          The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see

    """
    Type definition for `ClientListHealthChecksResponseHealthChecks` `HealthCheckConfig`

    A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

    - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

      The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
      checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
      resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that
      you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks
      the health of the endpoint.

      Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

      * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
      ``192.0.2.44`` .

      * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
      example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as
      described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

      If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
      associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
      This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

      For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
      .

      Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
      local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
      which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

      * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

      * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

      * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Port** *(integer) --*

      The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a
      value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
      determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

      You can create the following types of health checks:

      * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      .. warning::

         If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or
         later.

      * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
      that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
      string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

      * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
      of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ``ALARM`` ,
      the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to
      determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends on the
      setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
      ``LastKnownStatus`` .

      * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
      adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
      compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

      The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
      path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
      when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can
      also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

    - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

      Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

       **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

      Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
      the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks except
      TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
      want Route 53 to perform health checks.

      When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host`` header:

      * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      Host header.

      * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      ``Host`` header.

      * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , Route
      53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

      If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the value
      of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

       **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

      Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
      at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
      returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

      .. note::

        If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
        checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that
        you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
        failed" error.

      If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you
      choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that you
      create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
      HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

      .. warning::

        In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
        associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
        unpredictable.

      In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
      ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
      ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host`` header.

    - **SearchString** *(string) --*

      If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
      Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string
      appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

      Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

    - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

      The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint
      and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes
      requests at this interval.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

      If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53
      to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
      information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
      checks.

    - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
      multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
      **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

    - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example,
      to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

    - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

      Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
      happens:

      * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to
      your application, server, or other resource.

      * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health
      checks.

      * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
      corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

      After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always
      be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
      corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value
      of `Inverted
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
      .

      Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
      information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

    - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check that
      Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be considered
      healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED``
      health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
      element.

      Note the following:

      * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
      considers this health check to be unhealthy.

      * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

    - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

      (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck`` element
      for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

      - *(string) --*

    - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to
      the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint
      to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

      Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
      message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
      handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
      enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
      and confirm that your certificate is valid.

      The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
      and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain names
      in the certificate should match the value that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` .
      If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with a certificate that does not
      include the domain name that you specified in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker
      will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello`` message.

    - **Regions** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want Amazon
      Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

      If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from
      all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

      If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route
      53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
      checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four
      different regions).

      - *(string) --*

    - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
      checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

      - **Region** *(string) --*

        For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether
        this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

        For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
        and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
        determine whether this health check is healthy.

        .. note::

          Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

          * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
          information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
          in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

          * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics aren't
          supported.

    - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

      When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
      status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

      * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

      * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

      * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
      CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
      no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

      - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

        The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
        checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
        resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval
        that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then
        checks the health of the endpoint.

        Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

        * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
        ``192.0.2.44`` .

        * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
        example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
        as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

        If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
        associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
        This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

        For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
        .

        Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
        local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
        for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

        * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

        * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

        * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Port** *(integer) --*

        The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify
        a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --*

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
        determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

        You can create the following types of health checks:

        * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        .. warning::

           If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
           or later.

        * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
        submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
        string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
        53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for
        the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

        * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
        state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
        ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient
        data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends
        on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
        ``LastKnownStatus`` .

        * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
        53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
        and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

        For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

        The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
        The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
        3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You
        can also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=
            jp&login=y``
        .

      - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

        Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

         **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

        Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
        the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks
        except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
        which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

        When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
        header:

        * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        Host header.

        * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        ``Host`` header.

        * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
        Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

        If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
        value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

         **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

        Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
        returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

        .. note::

          If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
          checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
          that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
          resolution failed" error.

        If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
        you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that
        you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
        each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
        us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

        .. warning::

          In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
          associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
          unpredictable.

        In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
        ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
        ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
        header.

      - **SearchString** *(string) --*

        If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
        Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the
        string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

        Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

      - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

        The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
        endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
        checker makes requests at this interval.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

        If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route
        53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For
        more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
        checks.

      - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
        multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
        **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

      - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
        example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

      - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

        Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
        happens:

        * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
        to your application, server, or other resource.

        * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
        health checks.

        * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
        corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

        After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
        always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
        the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
        value of `Inverted
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
        .

        Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
        information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

      - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
        that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
        considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
        ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
        element.

        Note the following:

        * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
        considers this health check to be unhealthy.

        * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

      - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

        (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
        element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

        - *(string) --*

      - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
        endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
        certificate.

        Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
        message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
        handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
        enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
        and confirm that your certificate is valid.

        The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
        and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain
        names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with
        a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
        attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello``
        message.

      - **Regions** *(list) --*

        A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
        Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

        If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
        from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

        If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
        Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
        checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with
        four different regions).

        - *(string) --*

      - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
        checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

        - **Region** *(string) --*

          For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
          whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

          For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
          and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        - **Name** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
          determine whether this health check is healthy.

          .. note::

            Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

            * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
            information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
            aren't supported.

      - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

        When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
        status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

        * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

        * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

        * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
        CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
        no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

      The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
      ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

    - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
      monitoring for this health check.

      - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that the
        metric is compared to the threshold.

      - **Threshold** *(float) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
        compared with.

      - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
        is used for the comparison.

      - **Period** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one evaluation
        period in seconds.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

      - **Namespace** *(string) --*

        The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see
        `Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html>`__
        in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

      - **Statistic** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is applied
        to the metric.

      - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that contains
        information about the dimensions for the metric. For information, see `Amazon CloudWatch
        Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference

        - *(dict) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that contains
          information about one dimension.

          - **Name** *(string) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the name of one dimension.

          - **Value** *(string) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value of one dimension.

    Type definition for `ClientListHealthChecks` `Response`

    A complex type that contains the response to a ``ListHealthChecks`` request.

    - **HealthChecks** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``HealthCheck`` element for each health check that is
      associated with the current AWS account.

      - *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains information about one health check that is associated with the
        current AWS account.

        - **Id** *(string) --*

          The identifier that Amazon Route 53assigned to the health check when you created it. When
          you add or update a resource record set, you use this value to specify which health check
          to use. The value can be up to 64 characters long.

        - **CallerReference** *(string) --*

          A unique string that you specified when you created the health check.

        - **LinkedService** *(dict) --*

          If the health check was created by another service, the service that created the health
          check. When a health check is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it
          using Amazon Route 53.

          - **ServicePrincipal** *(string) --*

            If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, the service that
            created the resource. When a resource is created by another service, you can't edit or
            delete it using Amazon Route 53.

          - **Description** *(string) --*

            If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, an optional
            description that can be provided by the other service. When a resource is created by
            another service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

        - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

          - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

            The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform
            health checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS
            request to resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at
            the interval that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by
            DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

            Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

            * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for
            example, ``192.0.2.44`` .

            * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:),
            for example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6
            addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

            If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
            associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for
            ``IPAddress`` . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

            For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
            .

            Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
            local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP
            addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

            * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

            * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

            * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit
            ``IPAddress`` .

          - **Port** *(integer) --*

            The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
            Specify a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
            determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

            You can create the following types of health checks:

            * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
            submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
            than 400.

            * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
            submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
            than 400.

            .. warning::

               If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS
               v1.0 or later.

            * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful,
            Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body
            for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

            * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful,
            Route 53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response
            body for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

            * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

            * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
            state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
            ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
            sufficient data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check
            status depends on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` ,
            ``Unhealthy`` , or ``LastKnownStatus`` .

            * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks,
            Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to
            be healthy and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

            For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

            The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health
            checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status
            code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file
            /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also include query string parameters, for
            example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

          - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

            Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

             **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

            Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
            passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health
            checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the
            endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

            When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
            header:

            * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
            ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
            the Host header.

            * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH``
            for ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint
            in the ``Host`` header.

            * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
            Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host``
            header.

            If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
            value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

             **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

            Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` .
            Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

            .. note::

              If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send
              health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for
              the name that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails
              with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

            If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets
            and you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we
            recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create
            a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the
            value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
            us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

            .. warning::

              In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
              ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
              associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will
              be unpredictable.

            In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
            ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value
            for ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a
            ``Host`` header.

          - **SearchString** *(string) --*

            If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you
            want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If
            the string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

            Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

          - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

            The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
            endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
            checker makes requests at this interval.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

            If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30``
            seconds.

          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

            The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon
            Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
            versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
            Healthy

            If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three
            health checks.

          - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

            Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers
            in multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on
            the **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

          - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

            Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
            example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered
            healthy.

          - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

            Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's
            what happens:

            * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting
            requests to your application, server, or other resource.

            * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
            health checks.

            * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
            corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

            After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
            always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic
            to the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource,
            change the value of `Inverted
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
            .

            Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
            information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

          - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

            The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
            that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
            considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
            ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
            element.

            Note the following:

            * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53
            always considers this health check to be unhealthy.

            * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

          - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

            (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
            element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health
            check.

            - *(string) --*

          - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

            Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS
            negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with
            the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

            Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the
            ``client_hello`` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will
            be ``SSL alert handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other
            reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS
            configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

            The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name``
            field and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the
            domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message
            with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
            attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the
            ``client_hello`` message.

          - **Regions** *(list) --*

            A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
            Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

            If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
            from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

            If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
            Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some
            health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
            regions with four different regions).

            - *(string) --*

          - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

            A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
            checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

            - **Region** *(string) --*

              For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
              whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

              For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS
              Regions and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use
              to determine whether this health check is healthy.

              .. note::

                Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

                * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
                information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
                in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
                aren't supported.

          - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

            When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
            status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

            * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

            * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

            * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time
            that CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks
            that have no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

        - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

          The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
          ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

        - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53
          is monitoring for this health check.

          - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that
            the metric is compared to the threshold.

          - **Threshold** *(float) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
            compared with.

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation
            that is used for the comparison.

          - **Period** *(integer) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one
            evaluation period in seconds.

          - **MetricName** *(string) --*

            The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

          - **Namespace** *(string) --*

            The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see
            `Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

          - **Statistic** *(string) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is
            applied to the metric.

          - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

            contains information about the dimensions for the metric. For information, see `Amazon
            CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            - *(dict) --*

              For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that
              contains information about one dimension.

              - **Name** *(string) --*

                For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the name of one
                dimension.

              - **Value** *(string) --*

                For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value of one
                dimension.

    - **Marker** *(string) --*

      For the second and subsequent calls to ``ListHealthChecks`` , ``Marker`` is the value that you
      specified for the ``marker`` parameter in the previous request.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more health checks to be listed. If the response was
      truncated, you can get the next group of health checks by submitting another

      parameter.

    - **NextMarker** *(string) --*

      If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , the value of ``NextMarker`` identifies the first health check
      that Amazon Route 53 returns if you submit another ``ListHealthChecks`` request and specify
      the value of ``NextMarker`` in the ``marker`` parameter.

    - **MaxItems** *(string) --*

      of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

      .. note::

        The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API,
        such as ``api.example.com`` .

        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

      Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
      ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``

      `describe-vpc-endpoints
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

        CloudFront distribution

      Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

      Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
      the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
      *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of
      the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

      You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
      CloudFront distribution.

      .. note::

        For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary
        and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
        name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you
        can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.

        Elastic Beanstalk environment

      If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
      deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
      environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com``
      is a regionalized domain name.

      .. warning::

        For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
        region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
        alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For
        example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
        acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
        routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

      For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the ``CNAME``
      attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
      attribute:

      * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console,
      see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
      Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

      * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of the
      ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__ in
      the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

      * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the ``CNAME``
      attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
      in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

        ELB load balancer

      Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the
      AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

      * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the navigation
      pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the value of the **DNS
      name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins
      with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value
      that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

      * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
      ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

        * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

        Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

      Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for
      example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid values, see
      the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
      Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see
      `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

        Another Route 53 resource record set

      Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
      zone.

      .. note::

        If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
        zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of ``Type``
        is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
        you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
        even for an alias record.

    - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --*

       *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias
       resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias resource record
       set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or
       another resource record set in the hosted zone.

      Note the following:

        CloudFront distributions

      You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
      distribution.

        Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

      If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment contains an
      ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
      instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains
      an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set
      ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
      load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
      are healthy, if any.

      If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

        ELB load balancers

      Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

      * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName`` ,
      Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
      registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either
      no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
      to other resources.

      * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
      Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes queries to
      the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
      balancer:

        * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
        that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
        only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes
        queries to other resources.

        * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

      .. note::

        When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
        checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not
        create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
        balancer.

        S3 buckets

      There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the

      If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
      example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
      associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information,

    Type definition for `ClientListResourceRecordSetsResponseResourceRecordSets` `GeoLocation`

     *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon Route
     53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if you
     want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of ``192.0.2.111``
     , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

    .. note::

      Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
      supported.

    If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one
    resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes
    to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one
    resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

    You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.

    The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
    specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
    and ``Type`` elements.

    .. warning::

      Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
      mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
      cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
      can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
      ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
      haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
      mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no
      answer" response for queries from those locations.

    You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
    and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

    Information about the resource record set to create or delete.

    - **Name** *(string) --*

      For ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` requests, the name of the record that you want to create,
      update, or delete. For ``ListResourceRecordSets`` responses, the name of a record in the
      specified hosted zone.

       **ChangeResourceRecordSets Only**

      Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, ``www.example.com`` . You can optionally
      include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain
      name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats ``www.example.com``
      (without a trailing dot) and ``www.example.com.`` (with a trailing dot) as identical.

      For information about how to specify characters other than ``a-z`` , ``0-9`` , and ``-``
      (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see `DNS Domain Name Format
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name, for
      example, ``*.example.com`` . Note the following:

      * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify ``*prod.example.com`` or
      ``prod*.example.com`` .

      * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.

      * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats
      it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

      .. warning::

         You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS.

      You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example,
      ``*.example.com`` . You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example,
      ``marketing.*.example.com`` . In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example,
      you can't specify ``prod*.example.com`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The DNS record type. For information about different record types and how data is encoded for
      them, see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: ``A``
      | ``AAAA``
      | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME`` | ``MX`` | ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT`` . When
      creating a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, specify
      the same value for all of the resource record sets in the group.

      Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``MX``
      | ``NAPTR``
      | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

      .. note::

        SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
        However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value of
        ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of
        Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mechanism
        defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no
        longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see
        section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__
        .

      Values for alias resource record sets:

      * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

      * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two
      resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of ``A`` and one
      with a value of ``AAAA`` .

      * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

      * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

      * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

      * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

      * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource record
      set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS`` and ``SOA`` .

      .. note::

         If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
         zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of ``Type`` is
         ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record you're
         routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for
         an alias record.

    - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

       *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
       differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of name and
       type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com that have a type
       of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the value of
       ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

      For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **Weight** *(integer) --*

       *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
       combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that
       Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the
       sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name
       and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the
       total. Note the following:

      * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record set.

      * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

      * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same
      values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

      * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for
      the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

      * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0``
      for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for
      that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all resource record sets
      that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with
      equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to ``0`` is different when you associate
      health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see `Options for
      Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **Region** *(string) --*

       *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
       resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS resource,
       such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS
       domain name, depending on the record type.

      .. note::

        Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
        supported.

      When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
      created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that
      has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53
      then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

      Note the following:

      * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

      * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

      * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route
      53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you create latency
      resource record sets for.

      * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

    - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

       *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
       Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if
       you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
       ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a
       ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

      .. note::

        Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is
        not supported.

      If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example,
      one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
      goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent
      to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

      You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
      location.

      The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
      specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements.

      .. warning::

        Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
        mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
        cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
        can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
        ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
        haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
        mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a
        "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

      You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
      ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

      - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

        The two-letter code for the continent.

        Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

        Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or ``SubdivisionCode``
        returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

      - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

        The two-letter code for the country.

      - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

        The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United States.

    - **Failover** *(string) --*

       *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover`` element
       to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify ``PRIMARY`` as the
       value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you specify ``SECONDARY`` . In
       addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and specify the health check that you
       want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.

      Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
      ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

      * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
      applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
      secondary resource record set.

      * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is
      healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
      resource record set.

      * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
      the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
      primary resource record set.

      * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and if the
      primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the
      applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health
      of the associated endpoint.

      You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

      For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the ``EvaluateTargetHealth``
      element and set the value to true.

      For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

      * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

      * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

    - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

       *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly to
       multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each
       resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

      * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route
      53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is
      healthy.

      * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
      considers the record to be healthy.

      * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or
      fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.

      * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers
      with different combinations of healthy records.

      * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy
      records.

      * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
      typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

      You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

    - **TTL** *(integer) --*

      The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

      * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon Route 53
      uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

      * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
      ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or less so
      clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

      * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have the
      same value for ``TTL`` .

      * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource
      record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify
      a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that have the
      same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will change the
      effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

    - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

      Information about the resource records to act upon.

      .. note::

        If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

      - *(dict) --*

        Information specific to the resource record.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

        - **Value** *(string) --*

          The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of a
          ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error is
          returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record types, see
          `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__ in
          the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and ``SOA`` .

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

    - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

       *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a CloudFront
       distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

      If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

      * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
      CloudFront distribution.

      * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in a
      private hosted zone is unsupported.

      * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone, see
      `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --*

         *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
         traffic:

          Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

        Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS CLI
        command `get-domain-names
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

        * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

        * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

          Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

        Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
        ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

          CloudFront distribution

        Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

        .. note::

          Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

          Elastic Beanstalk environment

        Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
        environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the corresponding
        hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in the
        "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          ELB load balancer

        Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods to
        get the hosted zone ID:

        * `Elastic Load Balancing
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the "AWS
        Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use the
        value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note that
        there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for Network Load
        Balancers.

        * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
        navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone** field on
        the **Description** tab.

        * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable
        value. For more information, see the applicable guide:

          An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website

        Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more
        information about valid values, see the `Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ table in the "AWS
        Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

        Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
        reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

      - **DNSName** *(string) --*

         *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want to
         route queries:

          Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

        Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using the
        AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

        * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

        * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the
        name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

        .. note::

          The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API,
          such as ``api.example.com`` .

          Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

        Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
        ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
        . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
        distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
        `describe-vpc-endpoints
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

          CloudFront distribution

        Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

        Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
        the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
        *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of
        the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
        CloudFront distribution.

        .. note::

          For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
          primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that
          matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same
          name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.

          Elastic Beanstalk environment

        If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
        deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
        environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
        .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

        .. warning::

          For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
          region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of
          an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For
          example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic
          for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record
          that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

        For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the ``CNAME``
        attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the
        CNAME attribute:

        * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
        console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
        Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

        * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of the
        ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__ in
        the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

        * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the ``CNAME``
        attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
        in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

          ELB load balancer

        Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using
        the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

        * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
        navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the value
        of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the
        value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type of load
        balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

        * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
        ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

          * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

          Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

        Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in,
        for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid
        values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
        Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see
        `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

          Another Route 53 resource record set

        Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
        zone.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
          zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of ``Type``
          is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
          you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
          even for an alias record.

      - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --*

         *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted
         alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias resource
         record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer
         or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

        Note the following:

          CloudFront distributions

        You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
        distribution.

          Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

        If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment contains
        an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
        instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains
        an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set
        ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
        load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
        are healthy, if any.

        If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

          ELB load balancers

        Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

        * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName`` ,
        Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
        registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and
        either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53
        routes queries to other resources.

        * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
        Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes queries to
        the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
        balancer:

          * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
          that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group
          contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53
          routes queries to other resources.

          * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

        .. note::

          When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
          checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not
          create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
          balancer.

          S3 buckets

        There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the
        alias target is an S3 bucket.

          Other records in the same hosted zone

        If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
        example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
        associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information,
        see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

      If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only
      when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and
      specify the ID of the applicable health check.

      Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:

      * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check

      * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)

      * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

      .. warning::

        Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
        set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value`` element. When
        you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of
        the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

      For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

      * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

      * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

      * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

       **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

      Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
      or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
      choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
      the following configurations:

      * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
      resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
      weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
      all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is
      healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
      If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
      to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for
      all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record
      sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

      * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

        * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
        resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
        weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

        * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
        record set in the same hosted zone.

        * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

      If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be
      healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.

      If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
      alias resource record set.

      .. note::

        The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
        record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
        associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
        resource record sets.

       **Geolocation Routing**

      For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
      resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
      have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for
      North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which
      applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy,
      Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a
      resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

      * The United States

      * North America

      * The default resource record set

       **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

      If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a
      separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each ``HTTP``
      server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets (``www.example.com``
      ).

      .. warning::

        Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

        * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as the name
        of a resource record set.

        * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

    - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

      When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a resource
      record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route 53
      created this resource record set for.

      .. warning::

        To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
        ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
        automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` ,
        Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be
        charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

          Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, ``www.example.com`` . You can optionally
          include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the
          domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats

          |
          ``AAAA`` | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME`` | ``MX`` | ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` |
          ``TXT`` . When creating a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource
          record sets, specify the same value for all of the resource record sets in the group.

          Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``MX`` |
          ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

          .. note::

            SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
            However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value
            of ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of
            Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and
            mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly,
            its use is no longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it."
            In RFC 7208, see section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type
            <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__ .

          Values for alias resource record sets:

          * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

          * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create
          two resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of ``A``
          and one with a value of ``AAAA`` .

          * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

          * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

          * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

          * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

          * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource
          record set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS`` and
          ``SOA`` .

          .. note::

             If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as
             the zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of ``Type`` is
             ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record
             you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't
             supported even for an alias record.

        - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

           *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
           differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of name
           and type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com that have
           a type of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the
           value of ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

          For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **Weight** *(integer) --*

           *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
           combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries
           that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53
           calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same
           combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of
           a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:

          * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record
          set.

          * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

          * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the
          same values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

          * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values
          for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

          * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to
          ``0`` for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable
          value for that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all
          resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is
          routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to ``0``
          is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more
          information, see `Options for Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive
          Failover
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **Region** *(string) --*

           *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
           resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS
           resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP
           address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.

          .. note::

            Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
            supported.

          When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
          created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set
          that has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region.
          Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

          Note the following:

          * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

          * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

          * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions.
          Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you
          create latency resource record sets for.

          * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the
          ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

        - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

           *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
           Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For
           example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP
           address of ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a
           ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

          .. note::

            Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones
            is not supported.

          If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for
          example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same
          continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most
          queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that
          continent to a different resource.

          You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
          location.

          The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that
          aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for
          the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

          .. warning::

            Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses
            aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record
            sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from
            locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for
            which the value of ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from
            locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries
            from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource
            record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

          You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
          ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

          - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

            The two-letter code for the continent.

            Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

            Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or
            ``SubdivisionCode`` returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

          - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

            The two-letter code for the country.

          - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

            The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United
            States.

        - **Failover** *(string) --*

           *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover``
           element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify ``PRIMARY``
           as the value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you specify
           ``SECONDARY`` . In addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and specify the
           health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.

          Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
          ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

          * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
          the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
          secondary resource record set.

          * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set
          is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
          resource record set.

          * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
          with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of
          the primary resource record set.

          * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and if
          the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with
          the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of
          the health of the associated endpoint.

          You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the
          ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

          For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the
          ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` element and set the value to true.

          For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics in
          the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

          * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

          * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

        - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

           *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly
           to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each
           resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

          * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon
          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health
          check is healthy.

          * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
          considers the record to be healthy.

          * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or
          fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.

          * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS
          resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.

          * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight
          unhealthy records.

          * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
          typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

          You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

        - **TTL** *(integer) --*

          The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

          * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon Route
          53 uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

          * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
          ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or less
          so clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

          * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have
          the same value for ``TTL`` .

          * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource
          record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you
          specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets
          that have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load
          balancers) will change the effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

        - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

          Information about the resource records to act upon.

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

          - *(dict) --*

            Information specific to the resource record.

            .. note::

              If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of a
              ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error is
              returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record types,
              see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__
              in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and ``SOA``
              .

              .. note::

                If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

        - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

           *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a
           CloudFront distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

          If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

          * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic
          to a CloudFront distribution.

          * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in
          a private hosted zone is unsupported.

          * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone,
          see `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --*

             *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
             traffic:

              Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

            Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS
            CLI command `get-domain-names
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

            * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

            * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

              Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

            Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
            ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

              CloudFront distribution

            Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

            .. note::

              Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

              Elastic Beanstalk environment

            Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
            environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the
            corresponding hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in
            the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

              ELB load balancer

            Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods
            to get the hosted zone ID:

            * `Elastic Load Balancing
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the
            "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use
            the value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note
            that there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for
            Network Load Balancers.

            * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in
            the navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone**
            field on the **Description** tab.

            * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable
            value. For more information, see the applicable guide:

              * Classic Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
              to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

              * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers

              to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

              An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website

            Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more
            information about valid values, see the `Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ table in the "AWS
            Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

              Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

            Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
            reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

          - **DNSName** *(string) --*

             *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want
             to route queries:

              Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

            Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using
            the AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

            * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

            * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the
            name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

            .. note::

              The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your
              API, such as ``api.example.com`` .

              Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

            Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
            ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
            . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
            distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
            `describe-vpc-endpoints
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

              CloudFront distribution

            Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

            Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name
            of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
            *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one
            of the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names
            (CNAMEs)
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in
            the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
            CloudFront distribution.

            .. note::

              For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
              primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name
              that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
              the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one
              distribution.

              Elastic Beanstalk environment

            If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
            deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
            environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
            .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

            .. warning::

              For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include
              the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record
              instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root
              domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record
              that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but
              you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic
              Beanstalk environment.

            For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the
            ``CNAME`` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the
            value of the CNAME attribute:

            * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
            console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the
            *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

            * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of
            the ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__
            in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

            * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the
            ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
            in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

              ELB load balancer

            Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by
            using the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

            * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
            navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the
            value of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer,
            get the value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type
            of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

            * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
            ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

              * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

              * Application and Network Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__

            * **AWS CLI** : Use ``describe-load-balancers`` to get the value of ``DNSName`` . For
            more information, see the applicable guide:

              * Classic Load Balancers: `describe-load-balancers
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/describe-load-balancers.html>`__

              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html>`__

              Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

            Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket
            in, for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about
            valid values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon
            Web Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for
            websites, see `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in
            the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

              Another Route 53 resource record set

            Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current
            hosted zone.

            .. note::

              If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as
              the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of
              ``Type`` is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as
              the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone
              apex isn't supported even for an alias record.

          - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --*

             *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted
             alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias
             resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB
             load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

            Note the following:

              CloudFront distributions

            You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
            distribution.

              Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

            If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment
            contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy
            Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment
            automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2
            instance.) If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2
            instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
            to other available resources that are healthy, if any.

            If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
            requirements.

              ELB load balancers

            Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

            * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in
            ``DNSName`` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
            instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set
            ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load
            balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

            * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or
            Network Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes
            queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
            associated with the load balancer:

              * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target
              group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target
              group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and
              Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

              * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

            .. note::

              When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing
              health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar
              function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register
              with an ELB load balancer.

              S3 buckets

            There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when
            the alias target is an S3 bucket.

              Other records in the same hosted zone

            If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records
            (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend
            that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more
            information, see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
            *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

          If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query
          only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId`` element
          and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

          Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the
          following:

          * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check

          * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health
          checks)

          * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

          .. warning::

            Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource
            record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value``
            element. When you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53
            checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

          For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

          * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

          * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

          * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

           **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

          Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between
          two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base
          the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense
          only in the following configurations:

          * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
          resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
          weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs
          for all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is
          healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
          with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
          responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health
          check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers
          all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

          * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

            * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group
            of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as
            multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

            * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
            record set in the same hosted zone.

            * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

          If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
          be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
          with.

          If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using
          the alias resource record set.

          .. note::

            The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
            record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
            associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
            resource record sets.

           **Geolocation Routing**

          For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
          resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
          have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States,
          for North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` ,
          which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
          unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until
          it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

          * The United States

          * North America

          * The default resource record set

           **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

          If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you
          create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
          each ``HTTP`` server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
          ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets
          (``www.example.com`` ).

          .. warning::

            Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

            * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as the
            name of a resource record set.

            * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

        - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

          When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a
          resource record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy instance
          that Route 53 created this resource record set for.

          .. warning::

            To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
            ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
            automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using
            ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` , Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy
            instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether more resource record sets remain to be listed. If your results
      were truncated, you can make a follow-up pagination request by using the ``NextRecordName``
      element.

    - **NextRecordName** *(string) --*

      If the results were truncated, the name of the next record in the list.

      This element is present only if ``IsTruncated`` is true.

):
    """
    Type definition for `ClientUpdateHealthCheckResponseHealthCheck` `HealthCheckConfig`

    A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

    - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

      The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
      checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
      resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that
      you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks
      the health of the endpoint.

      Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

      * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
      ``192.0.2.44`` .

      * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
      example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as
      described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

      If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
      associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
      This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

      For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
      .

      Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
      local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
      which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

      * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

      * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

      * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Port** *(integer) --*

      The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a
      value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
      determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

      You can create the following types of health checks:

      * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      .. warning::

         If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or
         later.

      * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
      that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
      string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

      * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
      of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ``ALARM`` ,
      the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to
      determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends on the
      setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
      ``LastKnownStatus`` .

      * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
      adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
      compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

      The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
      path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
      when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can
      also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

    - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

      Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

       **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

      Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
      the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks except
      TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
      want Route 53 to perform health checks.

      When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host`` header:

      * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      Host header.

      * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      ``Host`` header.

      * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , Route
      53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

      If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the value
      of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

       **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

      Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
      at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
      returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

      .. note::

        If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
        checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that
        you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
        failed" error.

      If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you
      choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that you
      create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
      HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

      .. warning::

        In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
        associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
        unpredictable.

      In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
      ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
      ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host`` header.

    - **SearchString** *(string) --*

      If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
      Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string
      appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

      Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

    - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

      The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint
      and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes
      requests at this interval.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

      If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53
      to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
      information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
      checks.

    - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
      multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
      **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

    - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example,
      to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

    - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

      Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
      happens:

      * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to
      your application, server, or other resource.

      * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health
      checks.

      * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
      corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

      After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always
      be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
      corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value
      of `Inverted
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
      .

      Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
      information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

    - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check that
      Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be considered
      healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED``
      health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
      element.

      Note the following:

      * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
      considers this health check to be unhealthy.

      * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

    - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

      (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck`` element
      for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

      - *(string) --*

    - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to
      the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint
      to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

      Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
      message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
      handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
      enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
      and confirm that your certificate is valid.

      The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
      and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain names
      in the certificate should match the value that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` .
      If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with a certificate that does not
      include the domain name that you specified in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker
      will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello`` message.

    - **Regions** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want Amazon
      Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

      If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from
      all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

      If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route
      53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
      checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four
      different regions).

      - *(string) --*

    - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
      checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

      - **Region** *(string) --*

        For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether
        this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

    - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

      When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
      status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

      * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

      * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

      * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
      CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
      no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

      When a health check is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon
      Route 53.

      - **ServicePrincipal** *(string) --*

        If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, the service that created
        the resource. When a resource is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it
        using Amazon Route 53.

      - **Description** *(string) --*

        If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, an optional description
        that can be provided by the other service. When a resource is created by another service,
        you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

    - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

      - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

        The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
        checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
        resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval
        that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then
        checks the health of the endpoint.

        Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

        * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
        ``192.0.2.44`` .

        * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
        example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
        as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

        If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
        associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
        This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

        For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
        .

        Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
        local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
        for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

        * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

        * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

        * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Port** *(integer) --*

        The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify
        a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --*

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
        determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

        You can create the following types of health checks:

        * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        .. warning::

           If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
           or later.

        * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
        submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
        string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
        53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for
        the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

        * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
        state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
        ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient
        data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends
        on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
        ``LastKnownStatus`` .

        * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
        53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
        and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

        For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

        The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
        The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
        3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You
        can also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=
            jp&login=y``
        .

      - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

        Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

         **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

        Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
        the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks
        except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
        which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

        When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
        header:

        * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        Host header.

        * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        ``Host`` header.

        * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
        Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

        If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
        value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

         **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

        Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
        returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

        .. note::

          If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
          checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
          that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
          resolution failed" error.

        If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
        you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that
        you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
        each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
        us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

        .. warning::

          In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
          associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
          unpredictable.

        In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
        ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
        ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
        header.

      - **SearchString** *(string) --*

        If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
        Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the
        string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

        Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

      - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

        The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
        endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
        checker makes requests at this interval.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

        If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route
        53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For
        more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
        checks.

      - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
        multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
        **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

      - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
        example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

      - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

        Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
        happens:

        * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
        to your application, server, or other resource.

        * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
        health checks.

        * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
        corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

        After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
        always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
        the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
        value of `Inverted
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
        .

        Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
        information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

      - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
        that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
        considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
        ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
        element.

        Note the following:

        * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
        considers this health check to be unhealthy.

        * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

      - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

        (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
        element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

        - *(string) --*

      - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
        endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
        certificate.

        Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
        message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
        handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
        enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
        and confirm that your certificate is valid.

        The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
        and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain
        names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with
        a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
        attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello``
        message.

      - **Regions** *(list) --*

        A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
        Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

        If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
        from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

        If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
        Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
        checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with
        four different regions).

        - *(string) --*

      - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
        checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

        - **Region** *(string) --*

          For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
          whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

          For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
          and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        - **Name** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
          determine whether this health check is healthy.

          .. note::

            Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

            * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
            information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
            aren't supported.

      - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

        When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
        status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

        * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

        * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

        * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
        CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
        no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

      The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
      ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

    - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
      monitoring for this health check.

      - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that the
        metric is compared to the threshold.

      - **Threshold** *(float) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
        compared with.

      - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
        is used for the comparison.

      - **Period** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one evaluation
        period in seconds.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

      - **Namespace** *(string) --*

        The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see

      - **Statistic** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is applied
        to the metric.

      - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that contains
        information about the dimensions for the metric. For information, see `Amazon CloudWatch

    - **HealthCheck** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains the response to an ``UpdateHealthCheck`` request.

      - **Id** *(string) --*

        The identifier that Amazon Route 53assigned to the health check when you created it. When

        use. The value can be up to 64 characters long.

      - **CallerReference** *(string) --*

        A unique string that you specified when you created the health check.

      - **LinkedService** *(dict) --*

        If the health check was created by another service, the service that created the health
        check. When a health check is created by another service, you can't edit or delete it using
        Amazon Route 53.

        - **ServicePrincipal** *(string) --*

          If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, the service that

        - **Description** *(string) --*

          If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, an optional description
          that can be provided by the other service. When a resource is created by another service,
          you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

      - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

        - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

          The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform
          health checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS
          request to resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the
          interval that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS,
          Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

          * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
          ``192.0.2.44`` .

          * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
          example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
          as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

          If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
          associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress``
          . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

          Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
          local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
          for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

          * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

          * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
          <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

          * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress``
          .

        - **Port** *(integer) --*

          The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
          Specify a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

        - **Type** *(string) --*

          The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
          determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

          You can create the following types of health checks:

          * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
          an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

          * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
          submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than
          400.

          .. warning::

             If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
             or later.

          * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
          53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
          string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

          * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
          53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body
          for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

          * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

          * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
          state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
          ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
          sufficient data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check
          status depends on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` ,
          ``Unhealthy`` , or ``LastKnownStatus`` .

          * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
          53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be
          healthy and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

          For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

          The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
          The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx
          or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file
          /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also include query string parameters, for
          example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

        - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

          Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

           **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

          Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
          passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health
          checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the
          endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

          When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
          header:

          * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
          ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
          the Host header.

          * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
          ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
          the ``Host`` header.

          * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
          Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

          If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
          value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

           **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

          Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` .
          Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          .. note::

            If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
            checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
            that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
            resolution failed" error.

          If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
          you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend
          that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health
          check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
          us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

          .. warning::

            In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
            associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
            unpredictable.

          In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
          ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value
          for ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
          header.

        - **SearchString** *(string) --*

          If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you
          want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If
          the string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

          Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

        - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

          The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
          endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
          checker makes requests at this interval.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

          If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30``
          seconds.

        - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

          The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon
          Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
          versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
          Healthy
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
          checks.

        - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
          multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
          **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

          .. warning::

            You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

        - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
          example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered
          healthy.

        - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

          Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
          happens:

          * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
          to your application, server, or other resource.

          * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
          health checks.

          * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
          corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

          After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
          always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
          the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
          value of `Inverted
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
          .

          Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
          information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

        - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

          The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
          that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
          considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
          ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
          element.

          Note the following:

          * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
          considers this health check to be unhealthy.

          * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

        - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

          (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
          element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health
          check.

          - *(string) --*

        - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
          to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
          endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
          certificate.

          Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the
          ``client_hello`` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be
          ``SSL alert handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other
          reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS
          configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

          The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name``
          field and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the
          domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message
          with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
          attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the
          ``client_hello`` message.

        - **Regions** *(list) --*

          A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
          Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

          If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
          from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

          If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
          Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some
          health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
          regions with four different regions).

          - *(string) --*

        - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
          checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

          - **Region** *(string) --*

            For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
            whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

            For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS
            Regions and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          - **Name** *(string) --*

            The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
            determine whether this health check is healthy.

            .. note::

              Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

              * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
              information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
              in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

              * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
              aren't supported.

        - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

          When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
          status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

          * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

          * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

          * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time
          that CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks
          that have no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

      - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

        The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
        ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

      - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
        monitoring for this health check.

        - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that
          the metric is compared to the threshold.

        - **Threshold** *(float) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
          compared with.

        - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
          is used for the comparison.

        - **Period** *(integer) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one
          evaluation period in seconds.

        - **MetricName** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

        - **Namespace** *(string) --*

          The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see
          `Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference

        - **Statistic** *(string) --*

          For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is applied
          to the metric.

        - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

    Type definition for `ListHealthChecksPaginateResponseHealthChecks` `HealthCheckConfig`

    A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

    - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

      The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
      checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
      resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that
      you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks
      the health of the endpoint.

      Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

      * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
      ``192.0.2.44`` .

      * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
      example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as
      described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

      If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
      associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
      This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

      For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
      .

      Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
      local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
      which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

      * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

      * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
      <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

      * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Port** *(integer) --*

      The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a
      value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
      determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

      You can create the following types of health checks:

      * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an
      HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

      .. warning::

         If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or
         later.

      * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
      that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
      submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
      string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

      * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

      * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state
      of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ``ALARM`` ,
      the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to
      determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends on the
      setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
      ``LastKnownStatus`` .

      * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53
      adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and
      compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy

      The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
      path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
      when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can
      also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

    - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

      Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

       **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

      Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
      the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks except
      TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
      want Route 53 to perform health checks.

      When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host`` header:

      * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      Host header.

      * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
      ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
      ``Host`` header.

      * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , Route
      53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

      If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the value
      of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

       **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

      Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
      at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
      returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

      .. note::

        If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
        checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that
        you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
        failed" error.

      If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you
      choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that you
      create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
      HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

      .. warning::

        In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
        associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
        unpredictable.

      In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
      ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
      ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host`` header.

    - **SearchString** *(string) --*

      If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
      Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string
      appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

      Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

    - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

      The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint
      and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health checker makes
      requests at this interval.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

      If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53
      to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
      information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
      checks.

    - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
      multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
      **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

      .. warning::

        You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

    - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example,
      to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

    - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

      Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
      happens:

      * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests to
      your application, server, or other resource.

      * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health
      checks.

      * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
      corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

      After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always
      be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
      corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value
      of `Inverted
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
      .

      Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
      information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

    - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

      The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check that
      Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be considered
      healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED``
      health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
      element.

      Note the following:

      * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
      considers this health check to be unhealthy.

      * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

    - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

      (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck`` element
      for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

      - *(string) --*

    - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

      Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to
      the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint
      to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

      Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
      message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
      handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
      enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
      and confirm that your certificate is valid.

      The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
      and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain names
      in the certificate should match the value that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` .
      If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with a certificate that does not
      include the domain name that you specified in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker
      will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello`` message.

    - **Regions** *(list) --*

      A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want Amazon
      Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

      If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from
      all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

      If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Route
      53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
      checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four
      different regions).

      - *(string) --*

    - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
      checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

      - **Region** *(string) --*

        For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether
        this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

        For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
        and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
        determine whether this health check is healthy.

        .. note::

          Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

          * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
          information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
          in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

          * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics aren't
          supported.

    - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

      When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
      status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

      * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

      * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

      * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
      CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
      no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

      - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

        The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health
        checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS request to
        resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval
        that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then
        checks the health of the endpoint.

        Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

        * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example,
        ``192.0.2.44`` .

        * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for
        example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses
        as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

        If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
        associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for ``IPAddress`` .
        This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

        For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
        .

        Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
        local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses
        for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

        * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

        * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

        * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Port** *(integer) --*

        The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify
        a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --*

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
        determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

        You can create the following types of health checks:

        * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits
        an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

        .. warning::

           If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
           or later.

        * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
        submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
        string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
        53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for
        the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

        * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

        * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
        state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
        ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient
        data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check status depends
        on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` , ``Unhealthy`` , or
        ``LastKnownStatus`` .

        * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route
        53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
        and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

        For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

        The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks.
        The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
        3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You
        can also include query string parameters, for example, ``/welcome.html?language=
            jp&login=y``
        .

      - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

        Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

         **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

        Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes
        the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health checks
        except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
        which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

        When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
        header:

        * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        Host header.

        * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` for
        ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the
        ``Host`` header.

        * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
        Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host`` header.

        If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
        value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

         **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

        Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IPv4 address that DNS
        returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

        .. note::

          If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health
          checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name
          that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails with a "DNS
          resolution failed" error.

        If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and
        you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we recommend that
        you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
        each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
        us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

        .. warning::

          In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
          associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be
          unpredictable.

        In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
        ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value for
        ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a ``Host``
        header.

      - **SearchString** *(string) --*

        If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you want
        Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the
        string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

        Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

      - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

        The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
        endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
        checker makes requests at this interval.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

        If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30`` seconds.

      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon Route
        53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For
        more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three health
        checks.

      - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in
        multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the
        **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

        .. warning::

          You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

      - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
        example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

      - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

        Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's what
        happens:

        * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting requests
        to your application, server, or other resource.

        * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
        health checks.

        * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
        corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

        After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
        always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to
        the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the
        value of `Inverted
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
        .

        Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
        information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

      - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

        The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
        that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
        considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
        ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
        element.

        Note the following:

        * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always
        considers this health check to be unhealthy.

        * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

      - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

        (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
        element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health check.

        - *(string) --*

      - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

        Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName``
        to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS negotiation. This allows the
        endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
        certificate.

        Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the ``client_hello``
        message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be ``SSL alert
        handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is
        enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint
        and confirm that your certificate is valid.

        The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name`` field
        and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the domain
        names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message with
        a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
        ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
        attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the ``client_hello``
        message.

      - **Regions** *(list) --*

        A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
        Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

        If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
        from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

        If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
        Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health
        checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with
        four different regions).

        - *(string) --*

      - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

        A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
        checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

        - **Region** *(string) --*

          For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
          whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

          For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS Regions
          and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

        - **Name** *(string) --*

          The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to
          determine whether this health check is healthy.

          .. note::

            Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

            * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
            information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
            in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
            aren't supported.

      - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

        When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
        status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

        * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

        * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

        * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that
        CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have
        no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

      The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
      ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

    - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53 is
      monitoring for this health check.

      - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that the
        metric is compared to the threshold.

      - **Threshold** *(float) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
        compared with.

      - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation that
        is used for the comparison.

      - **Period** *(integer) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one evaluation
        period in seconds.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

      - **Namespace** *(string) --*

        The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see
        `Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html>`__
        in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

      - **Statistic** *(string) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the statistic that is applied
        to the metric.

      - **Dimensions** *(list) --*

        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, a complex type that contains
        information about the dimensions for the metric. For information, see `Amazon CloudWatch

          information about one dimension.

          - **Name** *(string) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the name of one dimension.

          - **Value** *(string) --*

      associated with the current AWS account.

      - *(dict) --*

        A complex type that contains information about one health check that is associated with the
        current AWS account.

        - **Id** *(string) --*

          The identifier that Amazon Route 53assigned to the health check when you created it. When
          you add or update a resource record set, you use this value to specify which health check
          to use. The value can be up to 64 characters long.

        - **CallerReference** *(string) --*

          - **Description** *(string) --*

            If the health check or hosted zone was created by another service, an optional
            description that can be provided by the other service. When a resource is created by
            another service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

        - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that contains detailed information about one health check.

          - **IPAddress** *(string) --*

            The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform
            health checks on. If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 sends a DNS
            request to resolve the domain name that you specify in ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at
            the interval that you specify in ``RequestInterval`` . Using an IP address returned by
            DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

            Use one of the following formats for the value of ``IPAddress`` :

            * **IPv4 address** : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for
            example, ``192.0.2.44`` .

            * **IPv6 address** : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:),
            for example, ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` . You can also shorten IPv6
            addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, ``2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`` .

            If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address,
            associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for
            ``IPAddress`` . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change.

            For more information, see `FullyQualifiedDomainName
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName>`__
            .

            Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in
            local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP
            addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

            * `RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735>`__

            * `RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598>`__

            * `RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156>`__

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``CALCULATED`` or ``CLOUDWATCH_METRIC`` , omit
            ``IPAddress`` .

          - **Port** *(integer) --*

            The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
            Specify a value for ``Port`` only when you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53
            determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

            You can create the following types of health checks:

            * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
            submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
            than 400.

            * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
            submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
            than 400.

            .. warning::

               If you specify ``HTTPS`` for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS
               v1.0 or later.

            * **HTTP_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful,
            Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body
            for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

            * **HTTPS_STR_MATCH** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful,
            Route 53 submits an ``HTTPS`` request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response
            body for the string that you specify in ``SearchString`` .

            * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

            * **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC** : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the
            state of the alarm is ``OK`` , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
            ``ALARM`` , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
            sufficient data to determine whether the state is ``OK`` or ``ALARM`` , the health check
            status depends on the setting for ``InsufficientDataHealthStatus`` : ``Healthy`` ,
            ``Unhealthy`` , or ``LastKnownStatus`` .

            * **CALCULATED** : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks,
            Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to
            be healthy and compares that number with the value of ``HealthThreshold`` .

            For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

            The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health
            checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status
            code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file
            /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also include query string parameters, for
            example, ``/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`` .

          - **FullyQualifiedDomainName** *(string) --*

            Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for ``IPAddress`` .

             **If you specify a value for**  ``IPAddress`` :

            Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and
            passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header for all health
            checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the
            endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.

            When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the ``Host``
            header:

            * If you specify a value of ``80`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTP`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` for
            ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in
            the Host header.

            * If you specify a value of ``443`` for ``Port`` and ``HTTPS`` or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH``
            for ``Type`` , Route 53 passes the value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint
            in the ``Host`` header.

            * If you specify another value for ``Port`` and any value except ``TCP`` for ``Type`` ,
            Route 53 passes ``FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`` to the endpoint in the ``Host``
            header.

            If you don't specify a value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , Route 53 substitutes the
            value of ``IPAddress`` in the ``Host`` header in each of the preceding cases.

             **If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` ** :

            Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` at the interval that you specify for ``RequestInterval`` .
            Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

            .. note::

              If you don't specify a value for ``IPAddress`` , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send
              health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for
              the name that you specify for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , the health check fails
              with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

            If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets
            and you choose to specify the endpoint only by ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , we
            recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create
            a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the
            value of ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
            us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).

            .. warning::

              In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of
              ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` matches the name of the resource record sets and you then
              associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will
              be unpredictable.

            In addition, if the value that you specify for ``Type`` is ``HTTP`` , ``HTTPS`` ,
            ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , or ``HTTPS_STR_MATCH`` , Route 53 passes the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` in the ``Host`` header, as it does when you specify a value
            for ``IPAddress`` . If the value of ``Type`` is ``TCP`` , Route 53 doesn't pass a
            ``Host`` header.

          - **SearchString** *(string) --*

            If the value of Type is ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` or ``HTTP_STR_MATCH`` , the string that you
            want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If
            the string appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

            Route 53 considers case when searching for ``SearchString`` in the response body.

          - **RequestInterval** *(integer) --*

            The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your
            endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Route 53 health
            checker makes requests at this interval.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``RequestInterval`` after you create a health check.

            If you don't specify a value for ``RequestInterval`` , the default value is ``30``
            seconds.

          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

            The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Amazon
            Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
            versa. For more information, see `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
            Healthy
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
            in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            If you don't specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` , the default value is three
            health checks.

          - **MeasureLatency** *(boolean) --*

            Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers
            in multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on
            the **Health Checks** page in the Route 53 console.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``MeasureLatency`` after you create a health check.

          - **Inverted** *(boolean) --*

            Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for
            example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered
            healthy.

          - **Disabled** *(boolean) --*

            Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a health check, here's
            what happens:

            * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops submitting
            requests to your application, server, or other resource.

            * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced
            health checks.

            * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops monitoring the
            corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

            After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to
            always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic
            to the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource,
            change the value of `Inverted
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-Inverted>`__
            .

            Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more
            information, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

          - **HealthThreshold** *(integer) --*

            The number of child health checks that are associated with a ``CALCULATED`` health check
            that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the ``CALCULATED`` health check to be
            considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
            ``CALCULATED`` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-ChildHealthChecks>`__
            element.

            Note the following:

            * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53
            always considers this health check to be unhealthy.

            * If you specify ``0`` , Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.

          - **ChildHealthChecks** *(list) --*

            (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one ``ChildHealthCheck``
            element for each health check that you want to associate with a ``CALCULATED`` health
            check.

            - *(string) --*

          - **EnableSNI** *(boolean) --*

            Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` to the endpoint in the ``client_hello`` message during TLS
            negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond to ``HTTPS`` health check requests with
            the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

            Some endpoints require that ``HTTPS`` requests include the host name in the
            ``client_hello`` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will
            be ``SSL alert handshake_failure`` . A health check can also have that status for other
            reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS
            configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

            The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the ``Common Name``
            field and possibly several more in the ``Subject Alternative Names`` field. One of the
            domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` . If the endpoint responds to the ``client_hello`` message
            with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
            ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second
            attempt, the health checker will omit ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` from the
            ``client_hello`` message.

          - **Regions** *(list) --*

            A complex type that contains one ``Region`` element for each region from which you want
            Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint.

            If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks
            from all of the regions that are listed under **Valid Values** .

            If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks,
            Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some
            health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
            regions with four different regions).

            - *(string) --*

          - **AlarmIdentifier** *(dict) --*

            A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health
            checkers to use to determine whether the specified health check is healthy.

            - **Region** *(string) --*

              For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health checkers to use to determine
              whether this health check is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

              For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see `Amazon CloudWatch
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region>`__ in the *AWS
              Regions and Endpoints* chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use
              to determine whether this health check is healthy.

              .. note::

                Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

                * Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more
                information, see `High-Resolution Metrics
                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics>`__
                in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

                * Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics
                aren't supported.

          - **InsufficientDataHealthStatus** *(string) --*

            When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the
            status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

            * ``Healthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

            * ``Unhealthy`` : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

            * ``LastKnownStatus`` : Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time
            that CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks
            that have no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

        - **HealthCheckVersion** *(integer) --*

          The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this value in a call to
          ``UpdateHealthCheck`` to prevent overwriting another change to the health check.

        - **CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration** *(dict) --*

          A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch alarm that Amazon Route 53
          is monitoring for this health check.

          - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the number of periods that
            the metric is compared to the threshold.

          - **Threshold** *(float) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the value the metric is
            compared with.

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the arithmetic operation
            that is used for the comparison.

          - **Period** *(integer) --*

            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with, the duration of one
            evaluation period in seconds.

          - **MetricName** *(string) --*

            The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associated with.

          - **Namespace** *(string) --*

            The namespace of the metric that the alarm is associated with. For more information, see
            `Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference

        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

      Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
      ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``

        CloudFront distribution

      Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

      Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
      the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
      *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of
      the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

      You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
      CloudFront distribution.

      .. note::

        For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary
        and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
        name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you
        can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.

        Elastic Beanstalk environment

      If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
      deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
      environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2* .elasticbeanstalk.com``
      is a regionalized domain name.

      .. warning::

        For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
        region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an
        alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For
        example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for
        acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that
        routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

      For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the ``CNAME``
      attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
      attribute:

      * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the console,
      see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
      Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

      * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of the
      ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__ in
      the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

      * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the ``CNAME``
      attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
      in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

        ELB load balancer

      Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the
      AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

      * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the navigation
      pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the value of the **DNS
      name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins
      with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value
      that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

      * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
      ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

        * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers

        Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

      Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for
      example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid values, see
      the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
      Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see
      `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

        Another Route 53 resource record set

      Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
      zone.

      .. note::

        If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
        zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of ``Type``
        is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
        you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
        even for an alias record.

    - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --*

       *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias
       resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias resource record
       set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or
       another resource record set in the hosted zone.

      Note the following:

        CloudFront distributions

      You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
      distribution.

        Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

      If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment contains an
      ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
      instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains
      an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set
      ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
      load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
      are healthy, if any.

      If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

        ELB load balancers

      Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

      * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName`` ,
      Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
      registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either
      no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
      to other resources.

      * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
      Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes queries to
      the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
      balancer:

        * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
        that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains
        only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes
        queries to other resources.

        * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

      .. note::

        When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
        checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not
        create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
        balancer.

        S3 buckets

      There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the
      alias target is an S3 bucket.

        Other records in the same hosted zone

      If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
      example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
      associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information,
      see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__

    Type definition for `ListResourceRecordSetsPaginateResponseResourceRecordSets` `GeoLocation`

     *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon Route

     want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of ``192.0.2.111``
     , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

    .. note::

      Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
      supported.

    If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one
    resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes
    to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one
    resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

    You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location.

    The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
    specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
    and ``Type`` elements.

    .. warning::

      Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
      mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
      cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
      can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
      ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
      haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
      mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no
      answer" response for queries from those locations.

    You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``

      you can't specify ``prod*.example.com`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The DNS record type. For information about different record types and how data is encoded for
      them, see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      Valid values for basic resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME``
      | ``MX`` |
      ``NAPTR`` | ``NS`` | ``PTR`` | ``SOA`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

      Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: ``A``
      | ``AAAA``
      | ``CAA`` | ``CNAME`` | ``MX`` | ``NAPTR`` | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT`` . When
      creating a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, specify
      the same value for all of the resource record sets in the group.

      Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: ``A`` | ``AAAA`` | ``MX``
      | ``NAPTR``
      | ``PTR`` | ``SPF`` | ``SRV`` | ``TXT``

      .. note::

        SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
        However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value of
        ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of
        Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mechanism
        defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no
        longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see
        section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__
        .

      Values for alias resource record sets:

      * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

      * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two
      resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of ``A`` and one
      with a value of ``AAAA`` .

      * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

      * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

      * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

      * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

      * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource record
      set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS`` and ``SOA`` .

      .. note::

         If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
         zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of ``Type`` is
         ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record you're
         routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for
         an alias record.

    - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

       *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
       differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of name and
       type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com that have a type
       of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the value of
       ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

      For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **Weight** *(integer) --*

       *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
       combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that
       Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the
       sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name
       and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the
       total. Note the following:

      * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record set.

      * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

      * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same
      values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

      * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for
      the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

      * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0``
      for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for
      that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all resource record sets
      that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with
      equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to ``0`` is different when you associate
      health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see `Options for
      Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **Region** *(string) --*

       *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
       resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS resource,
       such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS
       domain name, depending on the record type.

      .. note::

        Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
        supported.

      When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
      created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that
      has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53
      then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

      Note the following:

      * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

      * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

      * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route
      53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you create latency
      resource record sets for.

      * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

    - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

       *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
       Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if
       you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
       ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a
       ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

      .. note::

        Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is
        not supported.

      If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example,
      one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
      goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent
      to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

      You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
      location.

      The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that aren't
      specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements.

      .. warning::

        Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't
        mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that
        cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it
        can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of
        ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
        haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
        mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource record set, Route 53 returns a
        "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

      You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
      ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

      - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

        The two-letter code for the continent.

        Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

        Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or ``SubdivisionCode``
        returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

      - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

        The two-letter code for the country.

      - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

        The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United States.

    - **Failover** *(string) --*

       *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover`` element
       to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify ``PRIMARY`` as the
       value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you specify ``SECONDARY`` . In
       addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and specify the health check that you
       want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.

      Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
      ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

      * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
      applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
      secondary resource record set.

      * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is
      healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
      resource record set.

      * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
      the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
      primary resource record set.

      * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and if the
      primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the
      applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health
      of the associated endpoint.

      You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the ``Name``
      and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

      For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the ``EvaluateTargetHealth``
      element and set the value to true.

      For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics in the
      *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

      * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

      * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

    - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

       *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly to
       multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each
       resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

      * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route
      53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is
      healthy.

      * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
      considers the record to be healthy.

      * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or
      fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.

      * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers
      with different combinations of healthy records.

      * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy
      records.

      * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
      typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

      You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

    - **TTL** *(integer) --*

      The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

      * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon Route 53
      uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

      * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
      ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or less so
      clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

      * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have the
      same value for ``TTL`` .

      * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource
      record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify
      a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that have the
      same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will change the
      effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

    - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

      Information about the resource records to act upon.

      .. note::

        If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

      - *(dict) --*

        Information specific to the resource record.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

        - **Value** *(string) --*

          The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of a
          ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error is
          returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record types, see
          `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__ in
          the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and ``SOA`` .

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

    - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

       *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a CloudFront
       distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

      If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

      * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
      CloudFront distribution.

      * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in a
      private hosted zone is unsupported.

      * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone, see
      `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
      in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

      - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --*

         *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
         traffic:

          Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

        Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS CLI
        command `get-domain-names
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

        * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

        * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

          Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

        Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
        ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

          CloudFront distribution

        Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

        .. note::

          Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

          Elastic Beanstalk environment

        Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
        environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the corresponding
        hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in the
        "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          ELB load balancer

        Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods to
        get the hosted zone ID:

        * `Elastic Load Balancing
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the "AWS
        Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use the
        value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note that
        there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for Network Load
        Balancers.

        * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
        navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone** field on
        the **Description** tab.

        * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable
        value. For more information, see the applicable guide:

          * Classic Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
          to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

          * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
          to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

        * **AWS CLI** : Use ``describe-load-balancers`` to get the applicable value. For more
        information, see the applicable guide:

          * Classic Load Balancers: Use `describe-load-balancers
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/describe-load-balancers.html>`__ to
          get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

          * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `describe-load-balancers
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html>`__ to
          get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

          An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website

        Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more
        information about valid values, see the `Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ table in the "AWS
        Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

          Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

        Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
        reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

      - **DNSName** *(string) --*

         *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want to
         route queries:

          Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

        Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using the
        AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

        * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

        * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the
        name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

        .. note::

          The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your API,
          such as ``api.example.com`` .

          Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

        Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
        ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
        . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
        distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
        `describe-vpc-endpoints
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

          CloudFront distribution

        Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

        Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of
        the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
        *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one of
        the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
        CloudFront distribution.

        .. note::

          For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
          primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that
          matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same
          name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.

          Elastic Beanstalk environment

        If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
        deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
        environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
        .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

        .. warning::

          For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the
          region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of
          an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For
          example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic
          for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record
          that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

        For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the ``CNAME``
        attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the
        CNAME attribute:

        * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
        console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the *AWS
        Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

        * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of the
        ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments

          ELB load balancer

        Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using
        the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

        * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
        navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the value
        of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the
        value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type of load
        balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

          Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

        Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in,
        for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about valid
        values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon Web
        Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see
        `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

          Another Route 53 resource record set

        Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current hosted
        zone.

        .. note::

          If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the
          zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of ``Type``
          is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
          you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
          even for an alias record.

      - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --*

         *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted
         alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias resource
         record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer
         or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

        Note the following:

          CloudFront distributions

        You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
        distribution.

          Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

        If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment contains
        an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
        instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains
        an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set
        ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
        load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that
        are healthy, if any.

        If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

          ELB load balancers

        Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

        * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in ``DNSName`` ,
        Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
        registered with the load balancer. If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and
        either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53
        routes queries to other resources.

        * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or Network
        Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes queries to
        the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load
        balancer:

          * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group
          that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group
          contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53
          routes queries to other resources.

          * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

        .. note::

          When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health
          checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not
          create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
          balancer.

          S3 buckets

        There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the
        alias target is an S3 bucket.

          Other records in the same hosted zone

        If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records (for
        example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
        associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information,
        see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__
        in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

    - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

      If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only
      when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and
      specify the ID of the applicable health check.

      Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:

      * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check

      * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)

      * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

      .. warning::

        Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource record
        set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value`` element. When
        you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of
        the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

      For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

      * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

      * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

      * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
      <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

       **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

      Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two
      or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
      choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
      the following configurations:

      * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
      resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
      weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
      all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is
      healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
      If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
      to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for
      all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record
      sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

      * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

        * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group of
        resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
        weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

        * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
        record set in the same hosted zone.

        * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

      If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be
      healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.

      If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the
      alias resource record set.

      .. note::

        The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
        record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
        associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
        resource record sets.

       **Geolocation Routing**

      For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
      resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
      have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for
      North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which
      applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy,
      Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a
      resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

      * The United States

      * North America

      * The default resource record set

       **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

      If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a
      separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each ``HTTP``
      server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
      ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
      ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets (``www.example.com``
      ).

      .. warning::

        Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

        * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as the name
        of a resource record set.

        * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

    - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

      When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a resource
      record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route 53
      created this resource record set for.

      .. warning::

        To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
        ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
        automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` ,
        Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be
        charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

          Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, ``www.example.com`` . You can optionally
          include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the
          domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats
          ``www.example.com`` (without a trailing dot) and ``www.example.com.`` (with a trailing
          dot) as identical.

          * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify
          ``*prod.example.com`` or ``prod*.example.com`` .

          * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.

          * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS
          treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

          .. warning::

             You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS.

          You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example,
          ``*.example.com`` . You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example,
          ``marketing.*.example.com`` . In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for

          .. note::

            SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages.
            However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets for which the value
            of ``Type`` is ``SPF`` . RFC 7208, *Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of
            Domains in Email, Version 1* , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and
            mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperability issues. Accordingly,
            its use is no longer appropriate for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it."
            In RFC 7208, see section 14.1, `The SPF DNS Record Type
            <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1>`__ .

          Values for alias resource record sets:

          * **Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs:**  ``A``

          * **CloudFront distributions:**  ``A``   If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create
          two resource record sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with a value of ``A``
          and one with a value of ``AAAA`` .

          * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain** : ``A``

          * **ELB load balancers:**  ``A`` | ``AAAA``

          * **Amazon S3 buckets:**  ``A``

          * **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints**  ``A``

          * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** Specify the type of the resource
          record set that you're creating the alias for. All values are supported except ``NS`` and
          ``SOA`` .

          .. note::

             If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as
             the zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of ``Type`` is
             ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record
             you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't
             supported even for an alias record.

        - **SetIdentifier** *(string) --*

           *Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:* An identifier that
           differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of name
           and type, such as multiple weighted resource record sets named acme.example.com that have
           a type of A. In a group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the
           value of ``SetIdentifier`` must be unique for each resource record set.

          For information about routing policies, see `Choosing a Routing Policy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **Weight** *(integer) --*

           *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets that have the same
           combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries
           that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53
           calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same
           combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of
           a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:

          * You must specify a value for the ``Weight`` element for every weighted resource record
          set.

          * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per weighted resource record set.

          * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the
          same values for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as weighted resource record sets.

          * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values
          for the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

          * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set ``Weight`` to
          ``0`` for a resource record set, Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable
          value for that resource record set. However, if you set ``Weight`` to ``0`` for all
          resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is
          routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting ``Weight`` to ``0``
          is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more
          information, see `Options for Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive
          Failover
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **Region** *(string) --*

           *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the
           resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS
           resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP
           address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.

          .. note::

            Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not
            supported.

          When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have
          created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects the latency resource record set
          that has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region.
          Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

          Note the following:

          * You can only specify one ``ResourceRecord`` per latency resource record set.

          * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.

          * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions.
          Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you
          create latency resource record sets for.

          * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the
          ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as latency resource record sets.

        - **GeoLocation** *(dict) --*

           *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets you control how Amazon
           Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For
           example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP
           address of ``192.0.2.111`` , create a resource record set with a ``Type`` of ``A`` and a
           ``ContinentCode`` of ``AF`` .

          .. note::

            Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones
            is not supported.

          If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for
          example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same
          continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most
          queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that
          continent to a different resource.

          You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic
          location.

          The value ``*`` in the ``CountryCode`` element matches all geographic locations that
          aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for
          the ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements.

          .. warning::

            Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses
            aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record
            sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from
            locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for
            which the value of ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` , which handles both queries that come from
            locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries
            from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a ``*`` resource
            record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

          You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
          ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as geolocation resource record sets.

          - **ContinentCode** *(string) --*

            The two-letter code for the continent.

            Valid values: ``AF`` | ``AN`` | ``AS`` | ``EU`` | ``OC`` | ``NA`` | ``SA``

            Constraint: Specifying ``ContinentCode`` with either ``CountryCode`` or
            ``SubdivisionCode`` returns an ``InvalidInput`` error.

          - **CountryCode** *(string) --*

            The two-letter code for the country.

          - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --*

            The code for the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United
            States.

        - **Failover** *(string) --*

           *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add the ``Failover``
           element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify ``PRIMARY``
           as the value for ``Failover`` ; for the other resource record set, you specify
           ``SECONDARY`` . In addition, you include the ``HealthCheckId`` element and specify the
           health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.

          Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the
          ``HealthCheckId`` element in both resource record sets:

          * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
          the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
          secondary resource record set.

          * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set
          is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
          resource record set.

          * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
          with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of
          the primary resource record set.

          * If you omit the ``HealthCheckId`` element for the secondary resource record set, and if
          the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with
          the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of
          the health of the associated endpoint.

          You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the
          ``Name`` and ``Type`` elements as failover resource record sets.

          For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the
          ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` element and set the value to true.

          For more information about configuring failover for Route 53, see the following topics in
          the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

          * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__

          * `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__

        - **MultiValueAnswer** *(boolean) --*

           *Multivalue answer resource record sets only* : To route traffic approximately randomly
           to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each
           resource and specify ``true`` for ``MultiValueAnswer`` . Note the following:

          * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon
          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health
          check is healthy.

          * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always
          considers the record to be healthy.

          * Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or
          fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.

          * If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS
          resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.

          * When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight
          unhealthy records.

          * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software
          typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.

          You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

        - **TTL** *(integer) --*

          The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:

          * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit ``TTL`` . Amazon Route
          53 uses the value of ``TTL`` for the alias target.

          * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a
          ``HealthCheckId`` element), we recommend that you specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds or less
          so clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

          * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have
          the same value for ``TTL`` .

          * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource
          record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you
          specify a ``TTL`` of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets
          that have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load
          balancers) will change the effect of the values that you specify for ``Weight`` .

        - **ResourceRecords** *(list) --*

          Information about the resource records to act upon.

          .. note::

            If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecords`` .

          - *(dict) --*

            Information specific to the resource record.

            .. note::

              If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``ResourceRecord`` .

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The current or new DNS record value, not to exceed 4,000 characters. In the case of a
              ``DELETE`` action, if the current value does not match the actual value, an error is
              returned. For descriptions about how to format ``Value`` for different record types,
              see `Supported DNS Resource Record Types
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html>`__
              in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              You can specify more than one value for all record types except ``CNAME`` and ``SOA``
              .

              .. note::

                If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit ``Value`` .

        - **AliasTarget** *(dict) --*

           *Alias resource record sets only:* Information about the AWS resource, such as a
           CloudFront distribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route traffic to.

          If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:

          * You can't create an alias resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic
          to a CloudFront distribution.

          * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in
          a private hosted zone is unsupported.

          * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone,
          see `Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html>`__
          in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --*

             *Alias resource records sets only* : The value used depends on where you want to route
             traffic:

              Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

            Specify the hosted zone ID for your API. You can get the applicable value using the AWS
            CLI command `get-domain-names
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

            * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalHostedZoneId`` .

            * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionHostedZoneId`` .

              Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

            Specify the hosted zone ID for your interface endpoint. You can get the value of
            ``HostedZoneId`` using the AWS CLI command `describe-vpc-endpoints
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

              CloudFront distribution

            Specify ``Z2FDTNDATAQYW2`` .

            .. note::

              Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.

              Elastic Beanstalk environment

            Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The
            environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the
            corresponding hosted zone IDs, see `AWS Elastic Beanstalk
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region>`__ in
            the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

              ELB load balancer

            Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods
            to get the hosted zone ID:

            * `Elastic Load Balancing
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region>`__ table in the
            "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* : Use
            the value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note
            that there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for
            Network Load Balancers.

            * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in
            the navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the **Hosted zone**
            field on the **Description** tab.

            * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the applicable
            value. For more information, see the applicable guide:

              * Classic Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html>`__
              to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneNameId`` .

              * Application and Network Load Balancers: Use `DescribeLoadBalancers

              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/describe-load-balancers.html>`__
              to get the value of ``CanonicalHostedZoneId`` .

              An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website

            Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more
            information about valid values, see the `Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ table in the "AWS
            Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .

              Another Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone

            Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't
            reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)

          - **DNSName** *(string) --*

             *Alias resource record sets only:* The value that you specify depends on where you want
             to route queries:

              Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs

            Specify the applicable domain name for your API. You can get the applicable value using
            the AWS CLI command `get-domain-names
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/get-domain-names.html>`__ :

            * For regional APIs, specify the value of ``regionalDomainName`` .

            * For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of ``distributionDomainName`` . This is the
            name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as ``da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net`` .

            .. note::

              The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for your
              API, such as ``api.example.com`` .

              Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

            Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
            ``vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com``
            . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding CloudFront
            distribution. You can get the value of ``DnsName`` using the AWS CLI command
            `describe-vpc-endpoints
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html>`__ .

              CloudFront distribution

            Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution.

            Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name
            of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is
            *acme.example.com* , your CloudFront distribution must include *acme.example.com* as one
            of the alternate domain names. For more information, see `Using Alternate Domain Names
            (CNAMEs)
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html>`__ in
            the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            You can't create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a
            CloudFront distribution.

            .. note::

              For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
              primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name
              that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
              the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one
              distribution.

              Elastic Beanstalk environment

            If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you
            deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
            environment. For example, the domain name ``my-environment.*us-west-2*
            .elasticbeanstalk.com`` is a regionalized domain name.

            .. warning::

              For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include
              the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record
              instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root
              domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record
              that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but
              you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic
              Beanstalk environment.

            For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the
            ``CNAME`` attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the
            value of the CNAME attribute:

            * *AWS Management Console* : For information about how to get the value by using the
            console, see `Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html>`__ in the
            *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide* .

            * *Elastic Beanstalk API* : Use the ``DescribeEnvironments`` action to get the value of
            the ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `DescribeEnvironments
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html>`__
            in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference* .

            * *AWS CLI* : Use the ``describe-environments`` command to get the value of the
            ``CNAME`` attribute. For more information, see `describe-environments
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html>`__
            in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference* .

              ELB load balancer

            Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by
            using the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.

            * **AWS Management Console** : Go to the EC2 page, choose **Load Balancers** in the
            navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the **Description** tab, and get the
            value of the **DNS name** field.  If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer,
            get the value that begins with **dualstack** . If you're routing traffic to another type
            of load balancer, get the value that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

            * **Elastic Load Balancing API** : Use ``DescribeLoadBalancers`` to get the value of
            ``DNSName`` . For more information, see the applicable guide:

              * Classic Load Balancers: `DescribeLoadBalancers

              Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

            Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket
            in, for example, ``s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`` . For more information about
            valid values, see the table `Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the *Amazon
            Web Services General Reference* . For more information about using S3 buckets for
            websites, see `Getting Started with Amazon Route 53
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html>`__ in
            the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.*

              Another Route 53 resource record set

            Specify the value of the ``Name`` element for a resource record set in the current
            hosted zone.

            .. note::

              If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as
              the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of
              ``Type`` is ``CNAME`` . This is because the alias record must have the same type as
              the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone
              apex isn't supported even for an alias record.

          - **EvaluateTargetHealth** *(boolean) --*

             *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted
             alias resource record sets:* When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is ``true`` , an alias
             resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB
             load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.

            Note the following:

              CloudFront distributions

            You can't set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when the alias target is a CloudFront
            distribution.

              Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains

            If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in ``DNSName`` and the environment
            contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy
            Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment
            automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2
            instance.) If you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no Amazon EC2
            instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
            to other available resources that are healthy, if any.

            If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
            requirements.

              ELB load balancers

            Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

            * **Classic Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in
            ``DNSName`` , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
            instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set
            ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load
            balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

            * **Application and Network Load Balancers** : If you specify an ELB Application or
            Network Load Balancer and you set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` , Route 53 routes
            queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
            associated with the load balancer:

              * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target
              group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target
              group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and
              Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

              * A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

            .. note::

              When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing
              health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar
              function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register
              with an ELB load balancer.

              S3 buckets

            There are no special requirements for setting ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to ``true`` when
            the alias target is an S3 bucket.

              Other records in the same hosted zone

            If the AWS resource that you specify in ``DNSName`` is a record or a group of records
            (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend
            that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more
            information, see `What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting>`__

            For more information and examples, see `Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html>`__ in the
            *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        - **HealthCheckId** *(string) --*

          If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query
          only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the ``HealthCheckId`` element
          and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

          Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the
          following:

          * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check

          * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health
          checks)

          * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

          .. warning::

            Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the resource
            record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the ``Value``
            element. When you add a ``HealthCheckId`` element to a resource record set, Route 53
            checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.

          For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* :

          * `How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__

          * `Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover

           **When to Specify HealthCheckId**

          Specifying a value for ``HealthCheckId`` is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between
          two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base
          the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense
          only in the following configurations:

          * **Non-alias resource record sets** : You're checking the health of a group of non-alias
          resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple
          weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs
          for all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is
          healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
          with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
          responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health
          check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers
          all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

          * **Alias resource record sets** : You specify the following settings:

            * You set ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for an alias resource record set in a group
            of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as
            multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).

            * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource
            record set in the same hosted zone.

            * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.

          If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to
          be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
          with.

          If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using
          the alias resource record set.

          .. note::

            The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group* of non-alias resource
            record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration,
            associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias
            resource record sets.

           **Geolocation Routing**

          For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a
          resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
          have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States,
          for North America, and a resource record set that has ``*`` for ``CountryCode`` is ``*`` ,
          which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
          unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until
          it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

          * The United States

          * North America

          * The default resource record set

           **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**

          If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you
          create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
          each ``HTTP`` server that is serving content for ``www.example.com`` . For the value of
          ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` , specify the domain name of the server (such as
          ``us-east-2-www.example.com`` ), not the name of the resource record sets
          (``www.example.com`` ).

          .. warning::

            Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:

            * Create a health check that has the same value for ``FullyQualifiedDomainName`` as the
            name of a resource record set.

            * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

        - **TrafficPolicyInstanceId** *(string) --*

          When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a
          resource record set. ``TrafficPolicyInstanceId`` is the ID of the traffic policy instance
          that Route 53 created this resource record set for.

          .. warning::

            To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use
            ``DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance`` . Route 53 will delete the resource record set
            automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using
            ``ChangeResourceRecordSets`` , Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy
            instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

      were truncated, you can make a follow-up pagination request by using the ``NextRecordName``
