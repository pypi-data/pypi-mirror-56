    The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to search, such as a specified header or
    a query string. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
      Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

      * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
      ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
      the name of the header in ``Data`` .

      * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
      is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
      ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
      ``?`` character, if any.

      * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
      ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
      send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
      request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
      ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
      or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
      set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

      * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
      as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
      characters.

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
      single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
      or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

    - **Data** *(string) --*

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
      AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
      is not case sensitive.

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
      that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
      parameter name is not case sensitive.

      If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you want AWS
    WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to
    search, and other settings.

    - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

      The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to search, such as a specified header or

        characters.

        * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
        single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
        or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

      - **Data** *(string) --*

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
        AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
        is not case sensitive.

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
        that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
        parameter name is not case sensitive.

        If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    - **TargetString** *(bytes) --*

      The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string
      in the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length
      of the value is 50 bytes.

      Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` :

      * ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that
      you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
      ``Referer`` header.

      * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the
      request. CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` ,
      ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string,
      which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character.

      * ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that
      identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
      send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request
      body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of
      the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests
      based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more
      information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

      * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
      as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
      characters.

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a
      single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value
      or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

      If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is
      case sensitive.

       **If you're using the AWS WAF API**

      Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before
      you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

      For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
      ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value
      ``BadBot`` , you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the
      resulting value, ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

       **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

      The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
      value.

    - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
      performs the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
      , with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

    - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --*

      Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
      string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
      following:

       **CONTAINS**

      The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but
      the location doesn't matter.

       **CONTAINS_WORD**

      The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
      ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
      or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

      * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request,
      such as the value of a header.

      * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
      followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
      example, ``BadBot;`` .

      * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is
      preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
      example, ``;BadBot`` .

      * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is
      preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore
      (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` .

       **EXACTLY**

      The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
      ``TargetString`` .

       **STARTS_WITH**

      The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the
      web request.

       **ENDS_WITH**

      The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
      request.

       UpdateByteMatchSet ), insert a ``ByteMatchSet`` into a ``Rule`` or delete one from a
       ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), and delete a ``ByteMatchSet`` from AWS WAF (see
       DeleteByteMatchSet ).

       ``ByteMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateByteMatchSet and by  ListByteMatchSets .

    - **Name** *(string) --*

      A friendly name or description of the  ByteMatchSet . You can't change ``Name`` after you
      create a ``ByteMatchSet`` .

    - **ByteMatchTuples** *(list) --*

      Specifies the bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you
      want AWS WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF
      to search, and other settings.

      - *(dict) --*

        The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you want AWS
        WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to
        search, and other settings.

        - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

          The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to search, such as a specified header or
          a query string. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
            Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

            * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
            ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
            the name of the header in ``Data`` .

            * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
            is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
            ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
            ``?`` character, if any.

            * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
            ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

            * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
            send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
            request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
            ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
            or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
            set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

            * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
            as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
            characters.

            * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
            single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
            or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

          - **Data** *(string) --*

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
            AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
            is not case sensitive.

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
            that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
            parameter name is not case sensitive.

            If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

        - **TargetString** *(bytes) --*

          The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string
          in the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length
          of the value is 50 bytes.

          Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` :

          * ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that
          you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
          ``Referer`` header.

          * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the
          request. CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` ,
          ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

          * ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string,
          which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character.

          * ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that
          identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

          * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
          send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request
          body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of
          the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests
          based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more
          information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

          * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
          as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
          characters.

          * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a
          single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value
          or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

          If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is
          case sensitive.

           **If you're using the AWS WAF API**

          Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before
          you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

          For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
          ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value
          ``BadBot`` , you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the
          resulting value, ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

           **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

          The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
          value.

        - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

          Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
          requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
          performs the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

          You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

           **CMD_LINE**

          When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
          command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
          option to perform the following transformations:

          * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

          * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

          * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

          * Replace multiple spaces with one space

          * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

           **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

          Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

          * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

          * \\t, tab, decimal 9

          * \\n, newline, decimal 10

          * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

          * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

          * non-breaking space, decimal 160

           ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

           **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

          Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
          ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

          * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
          , with the corresponding characters

          * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
          with the corresponding characters

           **LOWERCASE**

          Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

           **URL_DECODE**

          Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

           **NONE**

          Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

        - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --*

          Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
          string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
          following:

           **CONTAINS**

          The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but
          the location doesn't matter.

           **CONTAINS_WORD**

          The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
          ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
          or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

          * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request,
          such as the value of a header.

          * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
          followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
          example, ``BadBot;`` .

          * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is
          preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
          example, ``;BadBot`` .

          * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is
          preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore
          (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` .

           **EXACTLY**

          The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
          ``TargetString`` .

           **STARTS_WITH**

          The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the
          web request.

           **ENDS_WITH**

          The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
          request.

              * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
              ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
              the name of the header in ``Data`` .

              * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
              is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
              ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,

              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header

              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

          - **TargetString** *(bytes) --*

            The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string
            in the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length
            of the value is 50 bytes.

            Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` :

            * ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that
            you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
            ``Referer`` header.

            * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the
            request. CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` ,
            ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            * ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string,
            which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character.

            * ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that
            identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

            * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to

            based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more
            information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

            * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
            as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
            characters.

            * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a

            Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before
            you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

            For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
            ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value
            ``BadBot`` , you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the
            resulting value, ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

             **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

            The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
            value.

          - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
            requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
            performs the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
            command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
            option to perform the following transformations:

            * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

            * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

            * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

            * Replace multiple spaces with one space

            * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

             **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

            * \\t, tab, decimal 9

            * \\n, newline, decimal 10

            * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

          - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --*

            Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
            string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the

             **CONTAINS**

            The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but
            the location doesn't matter.

             **CONTAINS_WORD**

            The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
            ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
            or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

            * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request,
            such as the value of a header.

            * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
            followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
            example, ``BadBot;`` .

            * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is
            preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
            example, ``;BadBot`` .

            * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is
            preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore
            (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` .

             **EXACTLY**

            The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
            ``TargetString`` .

             **STARTS_WITH**

            The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the
            web request.

             **ENDS_WITH**

            The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
            request.

      - **RuleId** *(string) --*

        A unique identifier for a ``RateBasedRule`` . You use ``RuleId`` to get more information
        about a ``RateBasedRule`` (see  GetRateBasedRule ), update a ``RateBasedRule`` (see
        UpdateRateBasedRule ), insert a ``RateBasedRule`` into a ``WebACL`` or delete one from a
        ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``RateBasedRule`` from AWS WAF (see
        DeleteRateBasedRule ).

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description for a ``RateBasedRule`` . You can't change the name of a
        ``RateBasedRule`` after you create it.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description for the metrics for a ``RateBasedRule`` . The name can
        contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum
        length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including
        "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric after you create the
        ``RateBasedRule`` .

      - **MatchPredicates** *(list) --*

        The ``Predicates`` object contains one ``Predicate`` element for each  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet
        , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you want to include in a ``RateBasedRule`` .

        - *(dict) --*

          Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  XssMatchSet ,
          RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  SizeConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a
          ``Rule`` and, for each object, indicates whether you want to negate the settings, for
          example, requests that do NOT originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.

          - **Negated** *(boolean) --*

            Set ``Negated`` to ``False`` if you want AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
            based on the settings in the specified  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,
            XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeConstraintSet . For example, if an
            ``IPSet`` includes the IP address ``192.0.2.44`` , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
            based on that IP address.

            Set ``Negated`` to ``True`` if you want AWS WAF to allow or block a request based on the
            negation of the settings in the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,
            XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeConstraintSet . For example, if an
            ``IPSet`` includes the IP address ``192.0.2.44`` , AWS WAF will allow, block, or count
            requests based on all IP addresses *except*  ``192.0.2.44`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The type of predicate in a ``Rule`` , such as ``ByteMatch`` or ``IPSet`` .

          - **DataId** *(string) --*

            A unique identifier for a predicate in a ``Rule`` , such as ``ByteMatchSetId`` or
            ``IPSetId`` . The ID is returned by the corresponding ``Create`` or ``List`` command.

      - **RateKey** *(string) --*

        The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from single source
        and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for ``RateKey`` is ``IP`` . ``IP``
        indicates that requests arriving from the same IP address are subject to the ``RateLimit``
        that is specified in the ``RateBasedRule`` .

      - **RateLimit** *(integer) --*

        The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field specified by the
        ``RateKey`` , allowed in a five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the
        ``RateLimit`` and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers
        the action that is specified for this rule.

    - **ChangeToken** *(string) --*

      The ``ChangeToken`` that you used to submit the ``CreateRateBasedRule`` request. You can also
      use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see
      GetChangeTokenStatus .

      is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
      ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
      ``?`` character, if any.

      * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
      ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
      send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
      request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
      ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
      or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
      set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

      * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
      as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
      characters.

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
      single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
      or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

    - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
      performs the transformation on ``RegexPatternSet`` before inspecting a request for a
      match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

        DeleteRegexMatchSet ).

         ``RegexMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateRegexMatchSet and by  ListRegexMatchSets .

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description of the  RegexMatchSet . You can't change ``Name`` after you
        create a ``RegexMatchSet`` .

      - **RegexMatchTuples** *(list) --*

        Contains an array of  RegexMatchTuple objects. Each ``RegexMatchTuple`` object contains:

        * The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a query string or the
        value of the ``User-Agent`` header.

        * The identifier of the pattern (a regular expression) that you want AWS WAF to look for.
        For more information, see  RegexPatternSet .

        * Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting it to lowercase,
        before inspecting it for the specified string.

        - *(dict) --*

          The regular expression pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for in web requests, the
          location in requests that you want AWS WAF to search, and other settings. Each
          ``RegexMatchTuple`` object contains:

          * The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a query string or
          the value of the ``User-Agent`` header.

          * The identifier of the pattern (a regular expression) that you want AWS WAF to look for.
          For more information, see  RegexPatternSet .

          * Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting it to lowercase,
          before inspecting it for the specified string.

          - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

            Specifies where in a web request to look for the ``RegexPatternSet`` .

            - **Type** *(string) --*

              The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
              Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

              * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
              ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
              the name of the header in ``Data`` .

              * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
              is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
              ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
              ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

              * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
              send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
              request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
              ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
              is not case sensitive.

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

          - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
            requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
            performs the transformation on ``RegexPatternSet`` before inspecting a request for a
            match.

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

             **CMD_LINE**

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline
            command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
            option to perform the following transformations:

            * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

            * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

            * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

            * Replace multiple spaces with one space

            * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

             **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

            * \\t, tab, decimal 9

            * \\n, newline, decimal 10

            * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

          - **RegexPatternSetId** *(string) --*

            The ``RegexPatternSetId`` for a ``RegexPatternSet`` . You use ``RegexPatternSetId`` to
            get information about a ``RegexPatternSet`` (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a
            ``RegexPatternSet`` (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a ``RegexPatternSet`` into a
            ``RegexMatchSet`` or delete one from a ``RegexMatchSet`` (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ),
            and delete an ``RegexPatternSet`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).

             ``RegexPatternSetId`` is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by
             ListRegexPatternSets .

    - **ChangeToken** *(string) --*

      The ``ChangeToken`` that you used to submit the ``CreateRegexMatchSet`` request. You can also
      use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see
      GetChangeTokenStatus .

      is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
      ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
      ``?`` character, if any.

      * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
      ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
      send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
      request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
      ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
      or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
      set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

      * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
      as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
      characters.

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
      performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

      Note that if you choose ``BODY`` for the value of ``Type`` , you must choose ``NONE``
      for ``TextTransformation`` because CloudFront forwards only the first 8192 bytes for
      inspection.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
      , with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

    - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

      The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination
      with the provided ``Size`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of
      "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that
      expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match.

       **EQ** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

       **NE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is not equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

       **LE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is less than or equal to the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **LT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly less than the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **GE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is greater than or equal to the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **GT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly greater than the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

    - **Size** *(integer) --*

      The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified
      ``FieldToMatch`` . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ``ComparisonOperator`` and
      ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator``
      size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint``
      is considered to match.

      Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

      If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI counts as one

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
              ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

              * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
              send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
              request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
              ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
              is not case sensitive.

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

          - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
            requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
            performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

            Note that if you choose ``BODY`` for the value of ``Type`` , you must choose ``NONE``
            for ``TextTransformation`` because CloudFront forwards only the first 8192 bytes for
            inspection.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

             **CMD_LINE**

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
            command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
            option to perform the following transformations:

            * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

            * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

            * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

            * Replace multiple spaces with one space

            * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

             **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

            * \\t, tab, decimal 9

            * \\n, newline, decimal 10

            * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

            The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination
            with the provided ``Size`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of
            "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that
            expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match.

             **EQ** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

             **NE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is not equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

             **LE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is less than or equal to the size of the
             ``FieldToMatch``

             **LT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly less than the size of the
             ``FieldToMatch``

             **GE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is greater than or equal to the size of the
             ``FieldToMatch``

             **GT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly greater than the size of the
             ``FieldToMatch``

          - **Size** *(integer) --*

            The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified
            ``FieldToMatch`` . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ``ComparisonOperator`` and
            ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator``
            size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint``
            is considered to match.

            Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

            If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI counts as one
            character. For example, the URI ``/logo.jpg`` is nine characters long.

    - **ChangeToken** *(string) --*

      The ``ChangeToken`` that you used to submit the ``CreateSizeConstraintSet`` request. You can
      also use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see
      GetChangeTokenStatus .

    Type definition for `ClientCreateSqlInjectionMatchSet` `Response`

    The response to a ``CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet`` request.

    - **SqlInjectionMatchSet** *(dict) --*

      A  SqlInjectionMatchSet .

      - **SqlInjectionMatchSetId** *(string) --*

        A unique identifier for a ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` . You use ``SqlInjectionMatchSetId`` to
        get information about a ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` (see  GetSqlInjectionMatchSet ), update a
        ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` (see  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet ), insert a
        ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` into a ``Rule`` or delete one from a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ),
        and delete a ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet ).

         ``SqlInjectionMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet and by
         ListSqlInjectionMatchSets .

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        The name, if any, of the ``SqlInjectionMatchSet`` .

      - **SqlInjectionMatchTuples** *(list) --*

        Specifies the parts of web requests that you want to inspect for snippets of malicious SQL
        code.

        - *(dict) --*

          Specifies the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect for snippets of
          malicious SQL code and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

          - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

            Specifies where in a web request to look for snippets of malicious SQL code.

            - **Type** *(string) --*

              The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
              Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

              * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
              ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
              the name of the header in ``Data`` .

              * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
              is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
              ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
              ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

              * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
              send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
              request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
              ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
              is not case sensitive.

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

          - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
            requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
            performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

             **CMD_LINE**

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
            command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
            option to perform the following transformations:

            * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

            * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

            * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

            * Replace multiple spaces with one space

            * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

             **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

            * \\t, tab, decimal 9

            * \\n, newline, decimal 10

            * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

    - **ChangeToken** *(string) --*

      The ``ChangeToken`` that you used to submit the ``CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet`` request. You
      can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see
      GetChangeTokenStatus .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
       RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.
       Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a
       web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the
       request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

    - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

      An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
      ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

      Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic
      unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the
      specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then
      disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule
      groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

      Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
      changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
      ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
      metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

      If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web
      ACL, perform the following steps:

      * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For
      more information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

      * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

        * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
        UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that
        you want to exclude.

        * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
        exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
        ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

      - *(dict) --*

        The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
        ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the

        - **RuleId** *(string) --*

          The ``RuleId`` for a ``Rule`` . You use ``RuleId`` to get more information about a
          ``Rule`` (see  GetRule ), update a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), insert a ``Rule`` into a
          ``WebACL`` or delete a one from a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``Rule``
          from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).

           ``RuleId`` is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

        - **Action** *(dict) --*

          Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the
          conditions in the ``Rule`` . Valid values for ``Action`` include the following:

          * ``ALLOW`` : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

          * ``BLOCK`` : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

          * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the
          rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the
          web ACL.

           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup``
           to a ``WebACL`` . In this case, you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other
           update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of
           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a
            ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

            * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests

            * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests

            * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the
            conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the
            remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for
            a ``WebACL`` .

        - **OverrideAction** *(dict) --*

          Use the ``OverrideAction`` to test your ``RuleGroup`` .

          Any rule in a ``RuleGroup`` can potentially block a request. If you set the
          ``OverrideAction`` to ``None`` , the ``RuleGroup`` will block a request if any
          individual rule in the ``RuleGroup`` matches the request and is configured to block that
          request. However if you first want to test the ``RuleGroup`` , set the
          ``OverrideAction`` to ``Count`` . The ``RuleGroup`` will then override any block action
          specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching
          requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests
          using  GetSampledRequests .

           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup``
           to a ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other
           update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of
           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

             ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a
             ``RuleGroup`` . If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

        - **Type** *(string) --*

          The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
           RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.
           Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a
           web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the
           request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

        - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

          An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
          ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

          Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic
          unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the
          specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then
          disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule
          groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

          Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
          changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
          ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
          metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

          If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web
          ACL, perform the following steps:

          * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For
          more information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

          * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

            * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
            UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
            ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that
            you want to exclude.

            * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
            exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
            ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
            ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

          - *(dict) --*

            The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
            ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the
            ``RuleGroup`` that is specified by the ``ActivatedRule`` .

            - **RuleId** *(string) --*

              The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the rule group.

    - **WebACLArn** *(string) --*

      Tha Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL.

      - **DefaultAction** *(dict) --*

        The action to perform if none of the ``Rules`` contained in the ``WebACL`` match. The action
        is specified by the  WafAction object.

          The ``ActivatedRule`` object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a ``Rule`` that you
          want to insert or delete, the priority of the ``Rule`` in the ``WebACL`` , and the action
          that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the ``Rule`` (``ALLOW`` ,

          To specify whether to insert or delete a ``Rule`` , use the ``Action`` parameter in the
          WebACLUpdate data type.

          - **Priority** *(integer) --*

            Specifies the order in which the ``Rules`` in a ``WebACL`` are evaluated. Rules with a
            lower value for ``Priority`` are evaluated before ``Rules`` with a higher value. The

          - **Action** *(dict) --*

            Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the
            conditions in the ``Rule`` . Valid values for ``Action`` include the following:

            * ``ALLOW`` : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

            * ``BLOCK`` : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

             RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.
             Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a
             web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
      performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
      , with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

    An  XssMatchSet .

    - **XssMatchSetId** *(string) --*

      A unique identifier for an ``XssMatchSet`` . You use ``XssMatchSetId`` to get information
      about an ``XssMatchSet`` (see  GetXssMatchSet ), update an ``XssMatchSet`` (see

       ``XssMatchSetId`` is returned by  CreateXssMatchSet and by  ListXssMatchSets .

    - **Name** *(string) --*

      The name, if any, of the ``XssMatchSet`` .

    - **XssMatchTuples** *(list) --*

      Specifies the parts of web requests that you want to inspect for cross-site scripting
      attacks.

      - *(dict) --*

        Specifies the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site
        scripting attacks and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

          Specifies where in a web request to look for cross-site scripting attacks.

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
            Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

            * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
            ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
            the name of the header in ``Data`` .

            * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
            is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
            ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
            ``?`` character, if any.

            * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
            ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

            * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
            send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
            request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
            ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
            or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
            set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

            * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
            as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
            characters.

            * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
            single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
            or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

          - **Data** *(string) --*

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
            AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
            is not case sensitive.

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
            that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
            parameter name is not case sensitive.

            If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
      Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

      * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
      ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
      the name of the header in ``Data`` .

      * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
      is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
      ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
      ``?`` character, if any.

      * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
      ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
      send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
      request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
      ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
      or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
      set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

      * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
      as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
      characters.

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
      single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
      or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

    - **Data** *(string) --*

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
      AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
      is not case sensitive.

      When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
      that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
      parameter name is not case sensitive.

        If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    - **TargetString** *(bytes) --*

      The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string
      in the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length
      of the value is 50 bytes.

      Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` :

      * ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that
      you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
      ``Referer`` header.

      * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the
      request. CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` ,
      ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string,
      which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character.

      * ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that
      identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a
      single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value
      or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

      If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is
      case sensitive.

       **If you're using the AWS WAF API**

      Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before
      you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

      For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
      ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value
      ``BadBot`` , you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the
      resulting value, ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

       **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

      The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
      value.

    - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
      performs the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
      , with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

    - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --*

      Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
      string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
      following:

       **CONTAINS**

      The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but
      the location doesn't matter.

       **CONTAINS_WORD**

      The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
      ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
      or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

      * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request,
      such as the value of a header.

      * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
      followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
      example, ``BadBot;`` .

      * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is
      preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
      example, ``;BadBot`` .

      * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is
      preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore
      (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` .

       **EXACTLY**

      The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
      ``TargetString`` .

       **STARTS_WITH**

      The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the
      web request.

       **ENDS_WITH**

      The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
      request.

          Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

           **NONE**

          Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

        - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --*

          Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
          string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
          following:

           **CONTAINS**

          The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but
          the location doesn't matter.

           **CONTAINS_WORD**

          The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
          ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
          or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

          * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request,
          such as the value of a header.

          * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
          followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
          example, ``BadBot;`` .

          * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is
          preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
          example, ``;BadBot`` .

          * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is
          preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore
          (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` .

           **EXACTLY**

          The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
          ``TargetString`` .

           **STARTS_WITH**

          The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the
          web request.

           **ENDS_WITH**

          The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
          request.

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description of the  ByteMatchSet . You can't change ``Name`` after you
        create a ``ByteMatchSet`` .

      - **ByteMatchTuples** *(list) --*

        Specifies the bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you
        want AWS WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF
        to search, and other settings.

        - *(dict) --*

          The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you want AWS
          WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to
          search, and other settings.

          - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

            The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to search, such as a specified header or
            a query string. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

            - **Type** *(string) --*

              The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
              Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

              * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
              ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
              the name of the header in ``Data`` .

              * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
              is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
              ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
              ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

              * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
              send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
              request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
              ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
              is not case sensitive.

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

          - **TargetString** *(bytes) --*

            The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string
            in the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length
            of the value is 50 bytes.

            Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` :

            * ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that
            you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
            ``Referer`` header.

            * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the
            request. CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` ,
            ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            * ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string,
            which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character.

            * ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that
            identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

            * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
            send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request
            body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of
            the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests
            based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more
            information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

            * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
            as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
            characters.

            * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a
            single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value
            or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is
            case sensitive.

             **If you're using the AWS WAF API**

            Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before
            you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

            For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
            ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value
            ``BadBot`` , you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the
            resulting value, ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

             **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

            The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
            value.

          - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
            requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
            performs the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

             **CMD_LINE**

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
            command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
            option to perform the following transformations:

            * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

            * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

            * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

            * Replace multiple spaces with one space

            * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

             **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

            * \\t, tab, decimal 9

            * \\n, newline, decimal 10

            * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

          - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --*

            Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
            string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
            following:

             **CONTAINS**

            The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but
            the location doesn't matter.

             **CONTAINS_WORD**

            The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
            ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
            or _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

            * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request,
            such as the value of a header.

            * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
            followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
            example, ``BadBot;`` .

            * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is
            preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for
            example, ``;BadBot`` .

            * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is
            preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore
            (_), for example, ``-BadBot;`` .

             **EXACTLY**

            The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
            ``TargetString`` .

             **STARTS_WITH**

            The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the
            web request.

             **ENDS_WITH**

            The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
            request.

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

        value of the ``User-Agent`` header.

        * The identifier of the pattern (a regular expression) that you want AWS WAF to look for.
        For more information, see  RegexPatternSet .

        * Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting it to lowercase,
        before inspecting it for the specified string.

        - *(dict) --*

          The regular expression pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for in web requests, the
          location in requests that you want AWS WAF to search, and other settings. Each
          ``RegexMatchTuple`` object contains:

          - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

            Specifies where in a web request to look for the ``RegexPatternSet`` .

            - **Type** *(string) --*

              The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
              Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

              * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
              ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
              the name of the header in ``Data`` .

              * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
              is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
              ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
              ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

              * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
              send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
              request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
              ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
              is not case sensitive.

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

          - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
            requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
            performs the transformation on ``RegexPatternSet`` before inspecting a request for a
            match.

            You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

             **CMD_LINE**

            When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline
            command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
            option to perform the following transformations:

            * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

            * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

            * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

            * Replace multiple spaces with one space

            * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

             **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

            Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

            * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

            * \\t, tab, decimal 9

            * \\n, newline, decimal 10

            * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

        The friendly name or description for the ``Rule`` . You can't change the name of a ``Rule``
        after you create it.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description for the metrics for this ``Rule`` . The name can contain only
        alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It
        can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and
        "Default_Action." You can't change ``MetricName`` after you create the ``Rule`` .

      - **Predicates** *(list) --*

        The ``Predicates`` object contains one ``Predicate`` element for each  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet
        , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you want to include in a ``Rule`` .

        - *(dict) --*

          Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  XssMatchSet ,
          RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  SizeConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a
          ``Rule`` and, for each object, indicates whether you want to negate the settings, for
          example, requests that do NOT originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.

          - **Negated** *(boolean) --*

            Set ``Negated`` to ``False`` if you want AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
            based on the settings in the specified  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,
            XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeConstraintSet . For example, if an
            ``IPSet`` includes the IP address ``192.0.2.44`` , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
            based on that IP address.

            Set ``Negated`` to ``True`` if you want AWS WAF to allow or block a request based on the
            negation of the settings in the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,
            XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeConstraintSet . For example, if an
            ``IPSet`` includes the IP address ``192.0.2.44`` , AWS WAF will allow, block, or count
            requests based on all IP addresses *except*  ``192.0.2.44`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The type of predicate in a ``Rule`` , such as ``ByteMatch`` or ``IPSet`` .

          - **DataId** *(string) --*

            A unique identifier for a predicate in a ``Rule`` , such as ``ByteMatchSetId`` or
            ``IPSetId`` . The ID is returned by the corresponding ``Create`` or ``List`` command.

        * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
        single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
        or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

      - **Data** *(string) --*

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
        AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
        is not case sensitive.

        When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
        that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
        parameter name is not case sensitive.

        If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
      performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

      Note that if you choose ``BODY`` for the value of ``Type`` , you must choose ``NONE``
      for ``TextTransformation`` because CloudFront forwards only the first 8192 bytes for
      inspection.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
      , with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

    - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

      The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination
      with the provided ``Size`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of
      "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that
      expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match.

       **EQ** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

       **NE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is not equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

       **LE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is less than or equal to the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **LT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly less than the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **GE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is greater than or equal to the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **GT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly greater than the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

    - **Size** *(integer) --*

      The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified
      ``FieldToMatch`` . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ``ComparisonOperator`` and
      ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator``
      size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint``
      is considered to match.

      Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

      If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI counts as one
      character. For example, the URI ``/logo.jpg`` is nine characters long.

            The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
            Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

            * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
            ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
            the name of the header in ``Data`` .

            * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
            is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
            ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
            ``?`` character, if any.

            * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
            ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

            * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
            send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
            request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
            ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
            or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
            set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

            * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
            as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
            characters.

            * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a

            ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator``
            size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint``
            is considered to match.

            Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

            If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI counts as one
            character. For example, the URI ``/logo.jpg`` is nine characters long.

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
      command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
      option to perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

            * non-breaking space, decimal 160

             ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

             **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

            Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
            ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

            * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

            * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
            , with the corresponding characters

            * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
            with the corresponding characters

             **LOWERCASE**

            Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

             **URL_DECODE**

            Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

             **NONE**

            Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

      The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
       RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.
       Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a
       web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the
       request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

    - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

      An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
      ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

      Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic
      unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the
      specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then
      disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule
      groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

      Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
      changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
      ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
      metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

      If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web
      ACL, perform the following steps:

      * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For
      more information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

      * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

        * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
        UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that
        you want to exclude.

        * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
        exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
        ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

      - *(dict) --*

        The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
        ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the
        ``RuleGroup`` that is specified by the ``ActivatedRule`` .

          An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
          ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

          Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic
          unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the
          specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then
          disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule
          groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

          Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
          changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
          ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
          metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

          If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web
          ACL, perform the following steps:

          * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For
          more information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

          * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

            * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
            UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
            ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that
            you want to exclude.

            * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
            exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
            ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
            ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

          - *(dict) --*

            The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
            ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the
            ``RuleGroup`` that is specified by the ``ActivatedRule`` .

            - **RuleId** *(string) --*

              The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the rule group.

    - **WebACL** *(dict) --*

      Information about the  WebACL that you specified in the ``GetWebACL`` request. For more
      information, see the following topics:

      *  WebACL : Contains ``DefaultAction`` , ``MetricName`` , ``Name`` , an array of ``Rule``

      ``Priority`` , and ``RuleId``

      * ``Action`` : Contains ``Type``

      - **WebACLId** *(string) --*

        A unique identifier for a ``WebACL`` . You use ``WebACLId`` to get information about a
        ``WebACL`` (see  GetWebACL ), update a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), and delete a
        ``WebACL`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteWebACL ).

         ``WebACLId`` is returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .

      - **Name** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description of the ``WebACL`` . You can't change the name of a ``WebACL``
        after you create it.

      - **MetricName** *(string) --*

        A friendly name or description for the metrics for this ``WebACL`` . The name can contain
        only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length
        one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and
        "Default_Action." You can't change ``MetricName`` after you create the ``WebACL`` .

      - **DefaultAction** *(dict) --*

        The action to perform if none of the ``Rules`` contained in the ``WebACL`` match. The action
        is specified by the  WafAction object.

        - **Type** *(string) --*

          Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a
          ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

          * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests

          * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests

          * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the
          conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the
          remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for a
          ``WebACL`` .

      - **Rules** *(list) --*

        An array that contains the action for each ``Rule`` in a ``WebACL`` , the priority of the
        ``Rule`` , and the ID of the ``Rule`` .

        - *(dict) --*

          The ``ActivatedRule`` object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a ``Rule`` that you
          want to insert or delete, the priority of the ``Rule`` in the ``WebACL`` , and the action
          that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the ``Rule`` (``ALLOW`` ,
          ``BLOCK`` , or ``COUNT`` ).

          To specify whether to insert or delete a ``Rule`` , use the ``Action`` parameter in the
          WebACLUpdate data type.

          - **Priority** *(integer) --*

            Specifies the order in which the ``Rules`` in a ``WebACL`` are evaluated. Rules with a
            lower value for ``Priority`` are evaluated before ``Rules`` with a higher value. The
            value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple ``Rules`` to a ``WebACL`` , the
            values don't need to be consecutive.

          - **RuleId** *(string) --*

            The ``RuleId`` for a ``Rule`` . You use ``RuleId`` to get more information about a
            ``Rule`` (see  GetRule ), update a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), insert a ``Rule`` into a
            ``WebACL`` or delete a one from a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``Rule``
            from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).

             ``RuleId`` is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

          - **Action** *(dict) --*

            Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the
            conditions in the ``Rule`` . Valid values for ``Action`` include the following:

            * ``ALLOW`` : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

            * ``BLOCK`` : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

            * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the
            rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the
            web ACL.

             ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup``
             to a ``WebACL`` . In this case, you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other
             update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of
             ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

            - **Type** *(string) --*

              Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a
              ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

              * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests

              * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests

              * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the
              conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the
              remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for
              a ``WebACL`` .

          - **OverrideAction** *(dict) --*

            Use the ``OverrideAction`` to test your ``RuleGroup`` .

            Any rule in a ``RuleGroup`` can potentially block a request. If you set the
            ``OverrideAction`` to ``None`` , the ``RuleGroup`` will block a request if any
            individual rule in the ``RuleGroup`` matches the request and is configured to block that
            request. However if you first want to test the ``RuleGroup`` , set the
            ``OverrideAction`` to ``Count`` . The ``RuleGroup`` will then override any block action
            specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching
            requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests
            using  GetSampledRequests .

             ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup``
             to a ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other
             update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of
             ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

            - **Type** *(string) --*

               ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a
               ``RuleGroup`` . If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
             RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.
             Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a
             web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the
             request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

          - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

            An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
            ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

        scripting attacks and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

        - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --*

          Specifies where in a web request to look for cross-site scripting attacks.

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
            Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

            * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
            ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
            the name of the header in ``Data`` .

            * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
            is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
            ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

            * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
            ``?`` character, if any.

            * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
            ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

            * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
            send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
            request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
            ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
            or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
            set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

            * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
            as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
            characters.

            * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
            single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
            or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

          - **Data** *(string) --*

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
            AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
            is not case sensitive.

            When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
            that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
            parameter name is not case sensitive.

            If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

        - **TextTransformation** *(string) --*

          Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
          requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF
          performs the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

          You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

           **CMD_LINE**

          When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line
          command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this
          option to perform the following transformations:

          * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

          * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

          * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

          * Replace multiple spaces with one space

          * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

           **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

          Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

          * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

          * \\t, tab, decimal 9

          * \\n, newline, decimal 10

          * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

          * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

          * non-breaking space, decimal 160

           ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

           **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

          Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
          ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

          * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

          * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;``
          , with the corresponding characters

          * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` ,
          with the corresponding characters

           **LOWERCASE**

          Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

           **URL_DECODE**

          Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

           **NONE**

          Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

      - **Type** *(string) --*

         ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a ``RuleGroup``
         . If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
      RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
      this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL
      without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to
      add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

    - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

      An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
      ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

      Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic
      unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific
      rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable
      (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and
      AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

      Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
      changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
      ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
      metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

      If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL,
      perform the following steps:

      * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more
      information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

      * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

        * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
        UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and

    - **NextMarker** *(string) --*

      If you have more ``ActivatedRules`` than the number that you specified for ``Limit`` in the
      request, the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value. To list more ``ActivatedRules`` ,
      submit another ``ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup`` request, and specify the ``NextMarker`` value
      from the response in the ``NextMarker`` value in the next request.

    - **ActivatedRules** *(list) --*

      An array of ``ActivatedRules`` objects.

      - *(dict) --*

        The ``ActivatedRule`` object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a ``Rule`` that you want
        to insert or delete, the priority of the ``Rule`` in the ``WebACL`` , and the action that
        you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the ``Rule`` (``ALLOW`` , ``BLOCK`` , or
        ``COUNT`` ).

        To specify whether to insert or delete a ``Rule`` , use the ``Action`` parameter in the
        WebACLUpdate data type.

        - **Priority** *(integer) --*

          Specifies the order in which the ``Rules`` in a ``WebACL`` are evaluated. Rules with a
          lower value for ``Priority`` are evaluated before ``Rules`` with a higher value. The value
          must be a unique integer. If you add multiple ``Rules`` to a ``WebACL`` , the values don't
          need to be consecutive.

        - **RuleId** *(string) --*

          The ``RuleId`` for a ``Rule`` . You use ``RuleId`` to get more information about a
          ``Rule`` (see  GetRule ), update a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), insert a ``Rule`` into a
          ``WebACL`` or delete a one from a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``Rule``
          from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).

           ``RuleId`` is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

        - **Action** *(dict) --*

          Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the
          conditions in the ``Rule`` . Valid values for ``Action`` include the following:

          * ``ALLOW`` : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

          * ``BLOCK`` : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

          * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the
          rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web
          ACL.

           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to
           a ``WebACL`` . In this case, you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other
           update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of
           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a
            ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

            * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests

            * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests

            * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the
            conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the
            remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for a
            ``WebACL`` .

        - **OverrideAction** *(dict) --*

          Use the ``OverrideAction`` to test your ``RuleGroup`` .

          Any rule in a ``RuleGroup`` can potentially block a request. If you set the
          ``OverrideAction`` to ``None`` , the ``RuleGroup`` will block a request if any individual
          rule in the ``RuleGroup`` matches the request and is configured to block that request.
          However if you first want to test the ``RuleGroup`` , set the ``OverrideAction`` to
          ``Count`` . The ``RuleGroup`` will then override any block action specified by individual
          rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests
          will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .

           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to
           a ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other
           update requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of
           ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

          - **Type** *(string) --*

             ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a ``RuleGroup``
             . If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

        - **Type** *(string) --*

          The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
          RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
          this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL
          without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to
          add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

        - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

          An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
          ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

          Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic
          unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific
          rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable
          (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and
          AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

          Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
          changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
          ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
          metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

          If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL,
          perform the following steps:

          * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more
          information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

          * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

            * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
            UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
            ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that
            you want to exclude.

            * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
            exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
            ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
            ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

          - *(dict) --*

            The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
            ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the ``RuleGroup``
            that is specified by the ``ActivatedRule`` .

            - **RuleId** *(string) --*

            - **Type** *(string) --*

              The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string.
              Parts of a request that you can search include the following:

              * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the
              ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify
              the name of the header in ``Data`` .

              * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request
              is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
              ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

              * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a
              ``?`` character, if any.

              * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
              ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

              * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to
              send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The
              request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first
              ``8192`` bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow
              or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint
              set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

              * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such
              as *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
              characters.

              * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
              single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value
              or regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

            - **Data** *(string) --*

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want
              AWS WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header
              is not case sensitive.

              When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter
              that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The
              parameter name is not case sensitive.

              If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    - **NextMarker** *(string) --*

      If you have more ``LoggingConfigurations`` than the number that you specified for ``Limit`` in
      the request, the response includes a ``NextMarker`` value. To list more
      ``LoggingConfigurations`` , submit another ``ListLoggingConfigurations`` request, and specify
      the ``NextMarker`` value from the response in the ``NextMarker`` value in the next request.

        If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

    - **TargetString** *(bytes) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string in
      the part of web requests that you specified in ``FieldToMatch`` . The maximum length of the
      value is 50 bytes.

      Valid values depend on the values that you specified for ``FieldToMatch`` :

      * ``HEADER`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you
      specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer``
      header.

      * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the
      request. CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE`` , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` ,
      ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

      * ``QUERY_STRING`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string,
      which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?`` character.

      * ``URI`` : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that
      identifies a resource, for example, ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

      immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of the
      request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on
      the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see
      CreateSizeConstraintSet .

      * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as
      *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30 characters.

      * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but instead of inspecting a single
      parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex
      pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

      If ``TargetString`` includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case
      sensitive.

       **If you're using the AWS WAF API**

      Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you
      base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

      For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
      ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value ``BadBot`` ,
      you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value,
      ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

       **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

      The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
      value.

    - **TextTransformation** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs
      the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command
      and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to
      perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with
      the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

    - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
      string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
      following:

       **CONTAINS**

      The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but the
      location doesn't matter.

       **CONTAINS_WORD**

      The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
      ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
      _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

      * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such
      as the value of a header.

      * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
      followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example,
      ``BadBot;`` .

      * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by
      a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ``;BadBot``
      .

      * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded
      and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for
      example, ``-BadBot;`` .

       **EXACTLY**

      The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
      ``TargetString`` .

       **STARTS_WITH**

      The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web
      request.

       **ENDS_WITH**

      The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
      request.

        Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you
        base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

        For example, suppose the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` and the value of ``Data`` is
        ``User-Agent`` . If you want to search the ``User-Agent`` header for the value ``BadBot`` ,
        you base64-encode ``BadBot`` using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value,
        ``QmFkQm90`` , in the value of ``TargetString`` .

         **If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs**

        The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the
        value.

      - **TextTransformation** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
        requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs
        the transformation on ``TargetString`` before inspecting a request for a match.

        You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

         **CMD_LINE**

        When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command
        and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to
        perform the following transformations:

        * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

        * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

        * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

        * Replace multiple spaces with one space

        * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

         **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

        Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

        * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

        * \\t, tab, decimal 9

        * \\n, newline, decimal 10

        * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

        * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

        * non-breaking space, decimal 160

         ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

         **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

        Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
        ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

        * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` ,
        with the corresponding characters

        * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with
        the corresponding characters

         **LOWERCASE**

        Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

         **URL_DECODE**

        Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

         **NONE**

        Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

      - **PositionalConstraint** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        Within the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query
        string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the
        following:

         **CONTAINS**

        The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , but the
        location doesn't matter.

         **CONTAINS_WORD**

        The specified part of the web request must include the value of ``TargetString`` , and
        ``TargetString`` must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
        _). In addition, ``TargetString`` must be a word, which means one of the following:

        * ``TargetString`` exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such
        as the value of a header.

        * ``TargetString`` is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is
        followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example,
        ``BadBot;`` .

        * ``TargetString`` is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by
        a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ``;BadBot``
        .

        * ``TargetString`` is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded
        and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for
        example, ``-BadBot;`` .

         **EXACTLY**

        The value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of
        ``TargetString`` .

         **STARTS_WITH**

        The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web
        request.

         **ENDS_WITH**

        The value of ``TargetString`` must appear at the end of the specified part of the web
        request.

      the transformation on ``RegexPatternSet`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline command
      and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to
      perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with
      the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

    - **RegexPatternSetId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The ``RegexPatternSetId`` for a ``RegexPatternSet`` . You use ``RegexPatternSetId`` to get
      information about a ``RegexPatternSet`` (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a
      ``RegexPatternSet`` (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a ``RegexPatternSet`` into a
      ``RegexMatchSet`` or delete one from a ``RegexMatchSet`` (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and
      delete an ``RegexPatternSet`` from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).

       ``RegexPatternSetId`` is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .

    - **Action** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple .

    - **RegexMatchTuple** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Information about the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect and the
      identifier of the regular expression (regex) pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for. If
      you specify ``DELETE`` for the value of ``Action`` , the ``RegexMatchTuple`` values must

        Specifies where in a web request to look for the ``RegexPatternSet`` .

        - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts
          of a request that you can search include the following:

          * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
          ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify the name of the header
          in ``Data`` .

          * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is
          asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE``
          , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

          * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?``
          character, if any.

          * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
          ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

          * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send
          to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body
          immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of the
          request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on
          the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see
          CreateSizeConstraintSet .

          * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as
          *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
          characters.

          * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
          single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or
          regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

        - **Data** *(string) --*

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want AWS
          WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header is not
          case sensitive.

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter that
          you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The parameter
          name is not case sensitive.

          If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

      this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL

      add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

    - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

      An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
      ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

      Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly
      (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the
      rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that
      particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace
      rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

      Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
      changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
      ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
      metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

      If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL,
      perform the following steps:

      * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more
      information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

      * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

        * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
        UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that you
        want to exclude.

        * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
        exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
        ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

      - *(dict) --*

        The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ``ActivatedRule``
        refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the ``RuleGroup`` that is specified by
        the ``ActivatedRule`` .

        and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.

         ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to a
         ``WebACL`` . In this case, you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other update
         requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

        - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a
          ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

          * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests

          * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests

          * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the
          conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the
          remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for a
          ``WebACL`` .

      - **OverrideAction** *(dict) --*

        Use the ``OverrideAction`` to test your ``RuleGroup`` .

        Any rule in a ``RuleGroup`` can potentially block a request. If you set the
        ``OverrideAction`` to ``None`` , the ``RuleGroup`` will block a request if any individual
        rule in the ``RuleGroup`` matches the request and is configured to block that request.
        However if you first want to test the ``RuleGroup`` , set the ``OverrideAction`` to
        ``Count`` . The ``RuleGroup`` will then override any block action specified by individual
        rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will
        be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .

         ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to a
         ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other update
         requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

        - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

           ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a ``RuleGroup`` .
           If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

      - **Type** *(string) --*

        The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
        RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
        this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL
        without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to
        add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

      - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

        An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
        ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

        Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly
        (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the
        rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that
        particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace
        rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

        Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
        changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
        ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
        metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

        If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL,
        perform the following steps:

        * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more
        information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

        * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

          * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
          UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
          ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that you
          want to exclude.

          * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
          exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
          ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
          ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

        - *(dict) --*

          The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ``ActivatedRule``
          refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the ``RuleGroup`` that is specified by
          the ``ActivatedRule`` .

          - **RuleId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the rule group.

    - **TextTransformation** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
      requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs
      the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

      You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

      Note that if you choose ``BODY`` for the value of ``Type`` , you must choose ``NONE`` for
      ``TextTransformation`` because CloudFront forwards only the first 8192 bytes for inspection.

       **NONE**

      Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

       **CMD_LINE**

      When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command
      and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to
      perform the following transformations:

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

      * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` ,
      with the corresponding characters

      * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with
      the corresponding characters

       **LOWERCASE**

      Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

       **URL_DECODE**

      Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

    - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination with
      the provided ``Size`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``
      ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the
      ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match.

       **EQ** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

       **NE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is not equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

       **LE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is less than or equal to the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **LT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly less than the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **GE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is greater than or equal to the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

       **GT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly greater than the size of the
       ``FieldToMatch``

    - **Size** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified
      ``FieldToMatch`` . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ``ComparisonOperator`` and
      ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator``
      size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is
      considered to match.

      Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

      If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI counts as one character.
      For example, the URI ``/logo.jpg`` is nine characters long.

          you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The parameter
          name is not case sensitive.

          If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

      - **TextTransformation** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
        requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs
        the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

        You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

        Note that if you choose ``BODY`` for the value of ``Type`` , you must choose ``NONE`` for
        ``TextTransformation`` because CloudFront forwards only the first 8192 bytes for inspection.

         **NONE**

        Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

         **CMD_LINE**

        When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command
        and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to
        perform the following transformations:

        * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

        * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

        * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

        * Replace multiple spaces with one space

        * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

         **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

        Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

        * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

        * \\t, tab, decimal 9

        * \\n, newline, decimal 10

        * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

        * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

        * non-breaking space, decimal 160

         ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

         **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

        Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
        ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

        * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` ,
        with the corresponding characters

        * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with
        the corresponding characters

         **LOWERCASE**

        Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

         **URL_DECODE**

        Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

      - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination with
        the provided ``Size`` and ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``
        ``ComparisonOperator`` size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the
        ``SizeConstraint`` is considered to match.

         **EQ** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

         **NE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is not equal to the size of the ``FieldToMatch``

         **LE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is less than or equal to the size of the
         ``FieldToMatch``

         **LT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly less than the size of the
         ``FieldToMatch``

         **GE** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is greater than or equal to the size of the
         ``FieldToMatch``

         **GT** : Used to test if the ``Size`` is strictly greater than the size of the
         ``FieldToMatch``

      - **Size** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified
        ``FieldToMatch`` . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ``ComparisonOperator`` and
        ``FieldToMatch`` to build an expression in the form of "``Size``  ``ComparisonOperator``
        size in bytes of ``FieldToMatch`` ". If that expression is true, the ``SizeConstraint`` is
        considered to match.

        Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

        If you specify ``URI`` for the value of ``Type`` , the / in the URI counts as one character.
        For example, the URI ``/logo.jpg`` is nine characters long.

    Type definition for `ClientUpdateWebAclUpdates` `ActivatedRule`

    The ``ActivatedRule`` object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a ``Rule`` that you want to
    insert or delete, the priority of the ``Rule`` in the ``WebACL`` , and the action that you
    want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the ``Rule`` (``ALLOW`` , ``BLOCK`` , or
    ``COUNT`` ).

    - **Priority** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Specifies the order in which the ``Rules`` in a ``WebACL`` are evaluated. Rules with a lower
      value for ``Priority`` are evaluated before ``Rules`` with a higher value. The value must be
      a unique integer. If you add multiple ``Rules`` to a ``WebACL`` , the values don't need to
      be consecutive.

    - **RuleId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The ``RuleId`` for a ``Rule`` . You use ``RuleId`` to get more information about a ``Rule``
      (see  GetRule ), update a ``Rule`` (see  UpdateRule ), insert a ``Rule`` into a ``WebACL``
      or delete a one from a ``WebACL`` (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a ``Rule`` from AWS WAF
      (see  DeleteRule ).

       ``RuleId`` is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

    - **Action** *(dict) --*

      Specifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the
      conditions in the ``Rule`` . Valid values for ``Action`` include the following:

      * ``ALLOW`` : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

      * ``BLOCK`` : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.

      * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule
      and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.

       ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to a
       ``WebACL`` . In this case, you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other update
       requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a
        ``Rule`` . Valid settings include the following:

        * ``ALLOW`` : AWS WAF allows requests

        * ``BLOCK`` : AWS WAF blocks requests

        * ``COUNT`` : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the
        conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the
        remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify ``COUNT`` for the default action for a
        ``WebACL`` .

    - **OverrideAction** *(dict) --*

      Use the ``OverrideAction`` to test your ``RuleGroup`` .

      Any rule in a ``RuleGroup`` can potentially block a request. If you set the
      ``OverrideAction`` to ``None`` , the ``RuleGroup`` will block a request if any individual
      rule in the ``RuleGroup`` matches the request and is configured to block that request.
      However if you first want to test the ``RuleGroup`` , set the ``OverrideAction`` to
      ``Count`` . The ``RuleGroup`` will then override any block action specified by individual
      rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will
      be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .

       ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` applies only when updating or adding a ``RuleGroup`` to a
       ``WebACL`` . In this case you do not use ``ActivatedRule|Action`` . For all other update
       requests, ``ActivatedRule|Action`` is used instead of ``ActivatedRule|OverrideAction`` .

      - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

         ``COUNT`` overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a ``RuleGroup`` .
         If set to ``NONE`` , the rule's action will take place.

    - **Type** *(string) --*

      The rule type, either ``REGULAR`` , as defined by  Rule , ``RATE_BASED`` , as defined by
      RateBasedRule , or ``GROUP`` , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
      this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL
      without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to
      add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.

    - **ExcludedRules** *(list) --*

      An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the
      ``ActivatedRule`` refers to a ``RuleGroup`` .

      Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly
      (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the
      rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that
      particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace
      rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

      Specifying ``ExcludedRules`` does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it
      changes the action for the rules to ``COUNT`` . Therefore, requests that match an
      ``ExcludedRule`` are counted but not blocked. The ``RuleGroup`` owner will receive COUNT
      metrics for each ``ExcludedRule`` .

      If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL,
      perform the following steps:

      * Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more
      information about the logs, see `Logging Web ACL Traffic Information
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html>`__ .

      * Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

        * The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the
        UpdateWebACL request, the first ``Updates:Action`` should be ``DELETE`` and
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that contains the rules that you
        want to exclude.

        * The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to
        exclude. That is, the second ``Updates:Action`` should be ``INSERT`` ,
        ``Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId`` should be the rule group that you just removed, and
        ``ExcludedRules`` should contain the rules that you want to exclude.

      - *(dict) --*

        The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ``ActivatedRule``
        refers to a ``RuleGroup`` . The rule must belong to the ``RuleGroup`` that is specified by
        the ``ActivatedRule`` .

        - **RuleId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the rule group.

      * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

      * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

      * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

      * Replace multiple spaces with one space

      * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

       **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

      Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

      * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

      * \\t, tab, decimal 9

      * \\n, newline, decimal 10

      * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

      * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

      * non-breaking space, decimal 160

       ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

       **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

      Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
      ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

      * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

    Type definition for `ClientUpdateXssMatchSet` `Updates`

    Specifies the part of a web request that you want to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks
    and indicates whether you want to add the specification to an  XssMatchSet or delete it from an
    ``XssMatchSet`` .

    - **Action** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Specify ``INSERT`` to add an  XssMatchSetUpdate to an  XssMatchSet . Use ``DELETE`` to remove
      an ``XssMatchSetUpdate`` from an ``XssMatchSet`` .

    - **XssMatchTuple** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      Specifies the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting
      attacks and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

      - **FieldToMatch** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        Specifies where in a web request to look for cross-site scripting attacks.

        - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts
          of a request that you can search include the following:

          * ``HEADER`` : A specified request header, for example, the value of the ``User-Agent`` or
          ``Referer`` header. If you choose ``HEADER`` for the type, specify the name of the header
          in ``Data`` .

          * ``METHOD`` : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is
          asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: ``DELETE``
          , ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , ``OPTIONS`` , ``PATCH`` , ``POST`` , and ``PUT`` .

          * ``QUERY_STRING`` : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ``?``
          character, if any.

          * ``URI`` : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example,
          ``/images/daily-ad.jpg`` .

          * ``BODY`` : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send
          to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body
          immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first ``8192`` bytes of the
          request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on
          the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see
          CreateSizeConstraintSet .

          * ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as
          *UserName* or *SalesRegion* . The maximum length for ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` is 30
          characters.

          * ``ALL_QUERY_ARGS`` : Similar to ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , but rather than inspecting a
          single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or
          regex pattern that you specify in ``TargetString`` .

        - **Data** *(string) --*

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``HEADER`` , enter the name of the header that you want AWS
          WAF to search, for example, ``User-Agent`` or ``Referer`` . The name of the header is not
          case sensitive.

          When the value of ``Type`` is ``SINGLE_QUERY_ARG`` , enter the name of the parameter that
          you want AWS WAF to search, for example, ``UserName`` or ``SalesRegion`` . The parameter
          name is not case sensitive.

          If the value of ``Type`` is any other value, omit ``Data`` .

      - **TextTransformation** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web
        requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs
        the transformation on ``FieldToMatch`` before inspecting a request for a match.

        You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

         **CMD_LINE**

        When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command
        and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to
        perform the following transformations:

        * Delete the following characters: \\ " ' ^

        * Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

        * Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

        * Replace multiple spaces with one space

        * Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

         **COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE**

        Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

        * \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

        * \\t, tab, decimal 9

        * \\n, newline, decimal 10

        * \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

        * \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

        * non-breaking space, decimal 160

         ``COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE`` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

         **HTML_ENTITY_DECODE**

        Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.
        ``HTML_ENTITY_DECODE`` performs the following operations:

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)quot;`` with ``"``

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)nbsp;`` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)lt;`` with a "less than" symbol

        * Replaces ``(ampersand)gt;`` with ``>``

        * Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, ``(ampersand)#xhhhh;`` ,
        with the corresponding characters

        * Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, ``(ampersand)#nnnn;`` , with
        the corresponding characters

         **LOWERCASE**

        Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

         **URL_DECODE**

        Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

         **NONE**

        Specify ``NONE`` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.
