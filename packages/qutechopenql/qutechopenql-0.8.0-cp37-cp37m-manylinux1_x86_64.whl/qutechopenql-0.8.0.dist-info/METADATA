Description: # OpenQL Framework #
        
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openql/badge/?version=latest)](https://openql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        OpenQL is a framework for high-level quantum programming in C++/Python. The framework provides a compiler for compiling and optimizing quantum code. The compiler produces the intermediate quantum assembly language and the compiled micro-code for various target platforms. While the microcode is platform-specific, the quantum assembly code (qasm) is hardware-agnostic and can be simulated on the QX simulator. For detailed documentation see [here](https://openql.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-docs/#).
