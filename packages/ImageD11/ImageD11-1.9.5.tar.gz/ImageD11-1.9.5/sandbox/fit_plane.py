"""
If you google for "fit plane points" you can find similar things. This 
uses an SVD to fit the plane to the points. The story goes:

    center of mass is in the plane
    vectors from the c.o.m to the points are in a space
    svd finds principal vectors for that space
    null vector (or smallest) is perpendicular to plane holding points

Then plane computations go via n.(r-c)=0

Enjoy!

# Fit a least squares plane to some data
# Data are likely to be the edge of a box from an integration
# ... but could be anything (eg: g-vectors etc)
