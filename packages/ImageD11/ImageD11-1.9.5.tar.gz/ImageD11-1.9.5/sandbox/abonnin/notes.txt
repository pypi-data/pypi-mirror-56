
fix_omega_angles.py
- puts the x position and omega from the peaksearch of 26000 images
  needs fixing to run properly (interactive notes)

make_point_sino.py
- reads grainspotter log file and original flt peaksearch with xpos
  Fits sinogram to get centre of mass of a grain

select_spatial_point.py
- Takes output of make_point_sino (x,y position, centre of rotation)
  Selects peaks in flt file where xpos matches the sinogram
  Can use this for re-indexing grain without bad peaks.

many_peak_searches.py
- ? not needed ? Does peaksearch per x translation

search_peaks.py
