          Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the ``PENDING`` state is preparing to enter the
          ``RUNNING`` state. A task set enters the ``PENDING`` status when it launches for the
          first time, or when it is restarted after being in the ``STOPPED`` state.

        - **runningCount** *(integer) --*

          The number of tasks in the task set that are in the ``RUNNING`` status during an
          Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the ``RUNNING`` state is running and ready for use.

        - **status** *(string) --*

          The status of the task set. There are three valid task set statuses:

          * ``PRIMARY`` : Indicates the task set is serving production traffic.

          * ``ACTIVE`` : Indicates the task set is not serving production traffic.

          * ``DRAINING`` : Indicates the tasks in the task set are being stopped and their
          corresponding targets are being deregistered from their target group.

        - **trafficWeight** *(float) --*

          The percentage of traffic served by this task set.

        - **targetGroup** *(dict) --*

          The target group associated with the task set. The target group is used by AWS
          CodeDeploy to manage traffic to a task set.

          - **name** *(string) --*

            For blue/green deployments, the name of the target group that instances in the
            original environment are deregistered from, and instances in the replacement
            environment are registered with. For in-place deployments, the name of the target
            group that instances are deregistered from, so they are not serving traffic during
            a deployment, and then re-registered with after the deployment is complete.

        - **taskSetLabel** *(string) --*

          A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an original target (``BLUE`` )
          or a replacement target (``GREEN`` ).

            The number of tasks in the task set that are in the ``PENDING`` status during an
            Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the ``PENDING`` state is preparing to enter the
            ``RUNNING`` state. A task set enters the ``PENDING`` status when it launches for the
            first time, or when it is restarted after being in the ``STOPPED`` state.

          - **runningCount** *(integer) --*

            The number of tasks in the task set that are in the ``RUNNING`` status during an

          - **status** *(string) --*

            The status of the task set. There are three valid task set statuses:

            * ``PRIMARY`` : Indicates the task set is serving production traffic.

            * ``ACTIVE`` : Indicates the task set is not serving production traffic.

            * ``DRAINING`` : Indicates the tasks in the task set are being stopped and their
            corresponding targets are being deregistered from their target group.

          - **trafficWeight** *(float) --*

            The percentage of traffic served by this task set.

          - **targetGroup** *(dict) --*

            The target group associated with the task set. The target group is used by AWS
            CodeDeploy to manage traffic to a task set.

            - **name** *(string) --*

              For blue/green deployments, the name of the target group that instances in the
              original environment are deregistered from, and instances in the replacement
              environment are registered with. For in-place deployments, the name of the target
              group that instances are deregistered from, so they are not serving traffic during
              a deployment, and then re-registered with after the deployment is complete.

          - **taskSetLabel** *(string) --*

            A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an original target (``BLUE`` )
            or a replacement target (``GREEN`` ).

          - **status** *(string) --*

            The status an Amazon ECS deployment's target ECS application.

          - **taskSetsInfo** *(list) --*

            The ``ECSTaskSet`` objects associated with the ECS target.

            - *(dict) --*

              Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in an AWS CodeDeploy deployment. An Amazon
              ECS task set includes details such as the desired number of tasks, how many tasks are
              running, and whether the task set serves production traffic. An AWS CodeDeploy
              application that uses the Amazon ECS compute platform deploys a containerized
              application in an Amazon ECS service as a task set.

              - **identifer** *(string) --*

                A unique ID of an ``ECSTaskSet`` .

              - **desiredCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of tasks in a task set. During a deployment that uses the Amazon ECS
                compute type, CodeDeploy instructs Amazon ECS to create a new task set and uses this
                value to determine how many tasks to create. After the updated task set is created,
                CodeDeploy shifts traffic to the new task set.

              - **pendingCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of tasks in the task set that are in the ``PENDING`` status during an
                Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the ``PENDING`` state is preparing to enter the
                ``RUNNING`` state. A task set enters the ``PENDING`` status when it launches for the
                first time, or when it is restarted after being in the ``STOPPED`` state.

              - **runningCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of tasks in the task set that are in the ``RUNNING`` status during an
                Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the ``RUNNING`` state is running and ready for use.

              - **status** *(string) --*

                The status of the task set. There are three valid task set statuses:

                * ``PRIMARY`` : Indicates the task set is serving production traffic.

                * ``ACTIVE`` : Indicates the task set is not serving production traffic.

                * ``DRAINING`` : Indicates the tasks in the task set are being stopped and their
                corresponding targets are being deregistered from their target group.

              - **trafficWeight** *(float) --*

                The percentage of traffic served by this task set.

              - **targetGroup** *(dict) --*

                The target group associated with the task set. The target group is used by AWS
                CodeDeploy to manage traffic to a task set.

                - **name** *(string) --*

                  For blue/green deployments, the name of the target group that instances in the
                  original environment are deregistered from, and instances in the replacement
                  environment are registered with. For in-place deployments, the name of the target
                  group that instances are deregistered from, so they are not serving traffic during
                  a deployment, and then re-registered with after the deployment is complete.

              - **taskSetLabel** *(string) --*

                A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an original target (``BLUE`` )
                or a replacement target (``GREEN`` ).

        .

        The error code:

        * APPLICATION_MISSING: The application was missing. This error code is most likely
        raised if the application is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is
        started.

        * DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_MISSING: The deployment group was missing. This error code is most
        likely raised if the deployment group is deleted after the deployment is created, but
        before it is started.

        * HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS: The deployment failed on too many instances to be successfully
        deployed within the instance health constraints specified.

        * HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS_INVALID: The revision cannot be successfully deployed within the
        instance health constraints specified.

        * IAM_ROLE_MISSING: The service role cannot be accessed.

        * IAM_ROLE_PERMISSIONS: The service role does not have the correct permissions.

        * INTERNAL_ERROR: There was an internal error.

        * NO_EC2_SUBSCRIPTION: The calling account is not subscribed to Amazon EC2.

        * NO_INSTANCES: No instances were specified, or no instances can be found.

        * OVER_MAX_INSTANCES: The maximum number of instances was exceeded.

        * THROTTLED: The operation was throttled because the calling account exceeded the
        throttling limits of one or more AWS services.

        * TIMEOUT: The deployment has timed out.

        * REVISION_MISSING: The revision ID was missing. This error code is most likely raised
        if the revision is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.

      - **message** *(string) --*

        An accompanying error message.

    - **createTime** *(datetime) --*

      A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was created.

    - **startTime** *(datetime) --*

      A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was deployed to the deployment group.

      In some cases, the reported value of the start time might be later than the complete time.
      This is due to differences in the clock settings of backend servers that participate in
      the deployment process.

    - **completeTime** *(datetime) --*

      A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was complete.

    - **deploymentOverview** *(dict) --*

      A summary of the deployment status of the instances in the deployment.

      - **Pending** *(integer) --*

        The number of instances in the deployment in a pending state.

      - **InProgress** *(integer) --*

        The number of instances in which the deployment is in progress.

      - **Succeeded** *(integer) --*

        The number of instances in the deployment to which revisions have been successfully
        deployed.

      - **Failed** *(integer) --*

        The number of instances in the deployment in a failed state.

      - **Skipped** *(integer) --*

        The number of instances in the deployment in a skipped state.

      - **Ready** *(integer) --*

        The number of instances in a replacement environment ready to receive traffic in a
        blue/green deployment.

    - **description** *(string) --*

      A comment about the deployment.

    - **creator** *(string) --*

      The means by which the deployment was created:

      * user: A user created the deployment.

      * autoscaling: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling created the deployment.

      * codeDeployRollback: A rollback process created the deployment.

    - **ignoreApplicationStopFailures** *(boolean) --*

      If true, then if an ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , or
      ``AfterBlockTraffic`` deployment lifecycle event to an instance fails, then the deployment
      continues to the next deployment lifecycle event. For example, if ``ApplicationStop``
      fails, the deployment continues with DownloadBundle. If ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` fails, the
      deployment continues with ``BlockTraffic`` . If ``AfterBlockTraffic`` fails, the
      deployment continues with ``ApplicationStop`` .

      If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an
      instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall
      deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy
      hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted.

      During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for
      ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and ``AfterBlockTraffic`` in the AppSpec
      file from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec
      file in the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not
      run successfully, the deployment can fail.

      If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will
      never run successfully, create a new deployment and use ``ignoreApplicationStopFailures``
      to specify that the ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and
      ``AfterBlockTraffic`` failures should be ignored.

    - **autoRollbackConfiguration** *(dict) --*

      Information about the automatic rollback configuration associated with the deployment.

          If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an
          instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall
          deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy
          hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted.

          During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for
          ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and ``AfterBlockTraffic`` in the AppSpec
          file from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec
          file in the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not
          run successfully, the deployment can fail.

          If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will
          never run successfully, create a new deployment and use ``ignoreApplicationStopFailures``
          to specify that the ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and
          ``AfterBlockTraffic`` failures should be ignored.

    Type definition for `ClientCreateDeploymentConfig` `minimumHealthyHosts`

    The minimum number of healthy instances that should be available at any time during the
    deployment. There are two parameters expected in the input: type and value.

    The type parameter takes either of the following values:

    * HOST_COUNT: The value parameter represents the minimum number of healthy instances as an
    absolute value.

    * FLEET_PERCENT: The value parameter represents the minimum number of healthy instances as a
    percentage of the total number of instances in the deployment. If you specify FLEET_PERCENT, at
    the start of the deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to the equivalent number of
    instance and rounds up fractional instances.

    The value parameter takes an integer.

    For example, to set a minimum of 95% healthy instance, specify a type of FLEET_PERCENT and a value
    of 95.

    - **value** *(integer) --*

      The minimum healthy instance value.

    - **type** *(string) --*

      The minimum healthy instance type:

      * HOST_COUNT: The minimum number of healthy instance as an absolute value.

      * FLEET_PERCENT: The minimum number of healthy instance as a percentage of the total number of
      instance in the deployment.

      In an example of nine instance, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified, deploy to up to three
      instances at a time. The deployment is successful if six or more instances are deployed to
      successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to
      up to five instance at a time. The deployment is successful if four or more instance are
      deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails.

      .. note::

        In a call to the ``GetDeploymentConfig`` , CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime returns a minimum
        healthy instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to only
        one instance at a time. (You cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or
        FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy attempts to

        For an AWS Lambda deployment, the content includes a Lambda function name, the alias for its
        original version, and the alias for its replacement version. The deployment shifts traffic
        from the original version of the Lambda function to the replacement version.

        For an Amazon ECS deployment, the content includes the task name, information about the load
        balancer that serves traffic to the container, and more.

        For both types of deployments, the content can specify Lambda functions that run at specified
        hooks, such as ``BeforeInstall`` , during a deployment.

        An accompanying error message.

    - **createTime** *(datetime) --*

      A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was created.

    - **startTime** *(datetime) --*

      A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was deployed to the deployment group.

      In some cases, the reported value of the start time might be later than the complete time.
      This is due to differences in the clock settings of backend servers that participate in the
      deployment process.

    - **completeTime** *(datetime) --*

      A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was complete.

    - **deploymentOverview** *(dict) --*

    - **ignoreApplicationStopFailures** *(boolean) --*

      If true, then if an ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , or ``AfterBlockTraffic``
      deployment lifecycle event to an instance fails, then the deployment continues to the next
      deployment lifecycle event. For example, if ``ApplicationStop`` fails, the deployment
      continues with DownloadBundle. If ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` fails, the deployment continues
      with ``BlockTraffic`` . If ``AfterBlockTraffic`` fails, the deployment continues with
      ``ApplicationStop`` .

      If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an
      instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall
      deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy
      hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted.

      During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for
      ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and ``AfterBlockTraffic`` in the AppSpec file
      from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec file in
      the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not run
      successfully, the deployment can fail.

      If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will never
      run successfully, create a new deployment and use ``ignoreApplicationStopFailures`` to
      specify that the ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and ``AfterBlockTraffic``
      failures should be ignored.

          CodeDeploy User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide>`__ .

          The error code:

          * APPLICATION_MISSING: The application was missing. This error code is most likely raised
          if the application is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.

          * DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_MISSING: The deployment group was missing. This error code is most
          likely raised if the deployment group is deleted after the deployment is created, but
          before it is started.

          * HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS: The deployment failed on too many instances to be successfully
          deployed within the instance health constraints specified.

          * HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS_INVALID: The revision cannot be successfully deployed within the
          instance health constraints specified.

          * IAM_ROLE_MISSING: The service role cannot be accessed.

          throttling limits of one or more AWS services.

          * TIMEOUT: The deployment has timed out.

          * REVISION_MISSING: The revision ID was missing. This error code is most likely raised if
          the revision is deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.

        - **message** *(string) --*

          An accompanying error message.

      - **createTime** *(datetime) --*

        A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was created.

      - **startTime** *(datetime) --*

        A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was deployed to the deployment group.

        In some cases, the reported value of the start time might be later than the complete time.
        This is due to differences in the clock settings of backend servers that participate in the
        deployment process.

      - **completeTime** *(datetime) --*

        A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was complete.

      - **deploymentOverview** *(dict) --*

        * codeDeployRollback: A rollback process created the deployment.

      - **ignoreApplicationStopFailures** *(boolean) --*

        If true, then if an ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , or ``AfterBlockTraffic``
        deployment lifecycle event to an instance fails, then the deployment continues to the next
        deployment lifecycle event. For example, if ``ApplicationStop`` fails, the deployment
        continues with DownloadBundle. If ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` fails, the deployment continues
        with ``BlockTraffic`` . If ``AfterBlockTraffic`` fails, the deployment continues with
        ``ApplicationStop`` .

        If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an
        instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall
        deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy
        hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted.

        During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for
        ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and ``AfterBlockTraffic`` in the AppSpec file
        from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec file in
        the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not run
        successfully, the deployment can fail.

        If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will never
        run successfully, create a new deployment and use ``ignoreApplicationStopFailures`` to
        specify that the ``ApplicationStop`` , ``BeforeBlockTraffic`` , and ``AfterBlockTraffic``
        failures should be ignored.

          - **status** *(string) --*

            The status of the task set. There are three valid task set statuses:

            * ``PRIMARY`` : Indicates the task set is serving production traffic.

            * ``ACTIVE`` : Indicates the task set is not serving production traffic.

            * ``DRAINING`` : Indicates the tasks in the task set are being stopped and their
            corresponding targets are being deregistered from their target group.

              For blue/green deployments, the name of the target group that instances in the
              original environment are deregistered from, and instances in the replacement
              environment are registered with. For in-place deployments, the name of the target
              group that instances are deregistered from, so they are not serving traffic during a
              deployment, and then re-registered with after the deployment is complete.

          - **taskSetLabel** *(string) --*

            A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an original target (``BLUE`` ) or
