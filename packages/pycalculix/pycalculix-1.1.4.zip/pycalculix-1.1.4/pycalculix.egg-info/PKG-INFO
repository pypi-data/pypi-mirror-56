Description: Python 3 library to automate and build finite element analysis (FEA) models in Calculix
        ================================================================================================
        
        * Meshing uses Calculix or GMSH
        * Website: http://justinablack.com/pycalculix/
        * Source Code: https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix
        * Documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/pycalculix/
        
        Useful applications of Pycalculix:
        -----------------------------------
        
        * Trade studies for plane stress, plane strain, or axisymmetric parts
        * Quick Kt analysis of 2D geometry
        * Learning finite element analyis (FEA) and Python
        
        Notes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        I build a chunker in python which tries to cut big areas (> 5 sides) which
        cgx can't mesh into smaller areas (<= 5 sides) which are meshable in cgx.
        The chunker may not always be able to cut areas correctly.
        
        Elements Supported:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Axisymmetric, plane stress, and plane strain elements are supported.
        First and second order triangles and quadrilaterals are supported.
        
        * First order elements only have corner nodes
        * Second order elements have corner and mid-side nodes
        
        Second order elements produce more accurate results
        Setting element divisions on lines is supported
        
        Geometry Building:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        One can build separate parts made of points, lines, arcs, and areas.
        One can draw a part made of straight lines, then smooth out corners by adding
        blends/fillets with the part method: part.fillet_lines(L1, L2, arc_radius)
        The new fillet will be tangent to both adjacent lines.
        
        Loading:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * Force loading
        * Constant pressure
        * Linearly varying pressure (water pressure)
        * Gravity
        * Rotational speed forces
        * Displacement constraints are supported
        * Loads are stored on geometry primitives (points lines etc) and can be applied before or after meshing
