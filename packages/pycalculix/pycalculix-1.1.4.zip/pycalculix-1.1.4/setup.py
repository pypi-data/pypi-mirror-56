Python 3 library to automate and build finite element analysis (FEA) models in Calculix
================================================================================================

* Meshing uses Calculix or GMSH
* Website: http://justinablack.com/pycalculix/
* Source Code: https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix
* Documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/pycalculix/

Useful applications of Pycalculix:
-----------------------------------

* Trade studies for plane stress, plane strain, or axisymmetric parts
* Quick Kt analysis of 2D geometry
* Learning finite element analyis (FEA) and Python

Notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I build a chunker in python which tries to cut big areas (> 5 sides) which
cgx can't mesh into smaller areas (<= 5 sides) which are meshable in cgx.
The chunker may not always be able to cut areas correctly.

Elements Supported:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Axisymmetric, plane stress, and plane strain elements are supported.
First and second order triangles and quadrilaterals are supported.

* First order elements only have corner nodes
* Second order elements have corner and mid-side nodes

Second order elements produce more accurate results
Setting element divisions on lines is supported

Geometry Building:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One can build separate parts made of points, lines, arcs, and areas.
One can draw a part made of straight lines, then smooth out corners by adding
blends/fillets with the part method: part.fillet_lines(L1, L2, arc_radius)
The new fillet will be tangent to both adjacent lines.

Loading:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Force loading
* Constant pressure
* Linearly varying pressure (water pressure)
* Gravity
* Rotational speed forces
* Displacement constraints are supported
* Loads are stored on geometry primitives (points lines etc) and can be applied before or after meshing
