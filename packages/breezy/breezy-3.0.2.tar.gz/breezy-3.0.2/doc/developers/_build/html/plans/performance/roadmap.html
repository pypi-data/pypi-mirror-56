<div class="section" id="planned-changes-to-the-bzr-core">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15"><span class="sectnum">1.1.1</span> Planned changes to the bzr core</a><a class="headerlink" href="#planned-changes-to-the-bzr-core" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Delivering the best possible performance requires changing the bzr core design
from that present in 0.16. Some of these changes are incremental and can be
done with no impact on disk format. Many of them however do require changes to
the disk format, and these can be broken into two sets of changes, those which
are sufficiently close to the model bzr uses today to interoperate with the
0.16 disk formats, and those that are not able to interoperate with the 0.16
disk formats - specifically some planned changes may result in data which
cannot be exported to bzr 0.16âs disk formats and then imported back to the new
format without losing critical information. If/when this takes place it will be
essentially a migration for users to switch from their bzr 0.16 repository to a
bzr that supports them. We plan to batch all such changes into one large
âexperimentalâ repository format, which will be complete stable and usable
before we migrate it to become a supported format. Getting new versions of bzr
in widespread use at that time will be very important, otherwise the user base
may be split in two - users that have upgraded and users that have not.</p>
<p>The following changes are grouped according to their compatibility impact:
library only, disk format but interoperable, disk format interoperability
unknown, and disk format, not interoperable.</p>
<div class="section" id="library-changes">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16"><span class="sectnum">1.1.1.1</span> Library changes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#library-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>These changes will change bzrlibâs API but will not affect the disk format and
thus do not pose a significant migration issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>For our 20 core use cases, we plan to add targeted APIâs to bzrlib that are
repository-representation agnostic. These will instead reflect the shape of
data access most optimal for that case.</p></li>
<li><p>Deprecate âversioned filesâ as a library concept. Instead of asking for
information about a file-over-time as a special case, we will move to an API
that assumes less coupling between the historical information and the
ability to obtain texts/deltas etc. Specifically, we need to remove all
APIâs that act in terms of on disk representation except those within a
given repository implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a validator for revisions that is more amenable to use by other parts
of the code base than just the gpg signing facility. This can be done today
without changing disk, possibly with a performance hit until the disk
formats match the validatory logic. It will be hard to tell if we have the
right routine for that until all the disk changes are complete, so while
this is a library only change, itâs likely one that will be delayed to near
the end of the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Add an explicit API for managing cached annotations. While annotations are
considered a cache this is not exposed in such a way that cache operations
like âdrop the cacheâ can be performed. On current disk formats the cache is
mandatory, but an API to manage would allow refreshing of the cache (e.g.
after ghosts are filled in during baz conversions).</p></li>
<li><p>Use the _iter_changes API to perform merges. This is a small change that may
remove the need to use inventories in merge, making a dramatic difference to
merge performance once the tree shape comparison optimisations are
implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a network-efficient revision graph API. This is the logic at the
start of push and pull operations, which currently scales O(graph size).
Fixing the scaling can be done, but there are tradeoffs to latency and
performance to consider, making it a little tricky to get right.</p></li>
<li><p>Working tree disk operation ordering. We plan to change the order in which
some operations are done (specifically TreeTransform ones) to improve
performance. There is already a 66% performance boost in that area going
through review.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop requiring full memory copies of files. Currently bzr requires that it
can hold 3 copies of any file itâs versioning in memory. Solving this is
tricky, particularly without performance regressions on small files, but
without solving it versioning of .iso and other large objects will continue
to be extremely painful.</p></li>
<li><p>Add an API for per-file graph access that alllows incremental access and is
suitable for on-demand generation if desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Repository stacking API. Allowing multiple databases to be stacked to give a
single ârepositoryâ will allow implementation of some long desired features
like history horizons, and bundle usage where the bundle is not added to the
local repository just to examine its contents.</p></li>
<li><p>Revision data manipulation API. We need a single streaming API for adding
data to or getting it from a repository. This will need to allow hints such
as âoptimise for sizeâ, or âoptimise for fast-additionâ to meet the various
users planned, but it is a core part of the library today, and itâs not
sufficiently clean to let us simplify/remove a lot of related code today.</p></li>

the annotation style, and when to do it, configurable. This will reduce data
sent over the wire when repositories have had âneeds-annotationsâ turned
off, which very large trees may choose to do - generating just-in-time
annotations may be desirable for those trees (even when performing
annotation based merges).</p></li>
<li><p>Repository disk operation ordering. The order that tasks access data within
the repository and the layout of the data should be harmonised. This will
require disk format changes but does not inherently alter the model, so itâs
straight forward to export from a repository that has been optimised in this
way to a 0.16 based repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Inventory representation. An inventory is a logical description of the shape
of a version controlled tree. Currently we operate on the whole inventory as
a tree broken down per directory, but we store it as a flat file. This scale
very poorly as even a minor change between inventories requires us to scan
the entire file, and in large trees this is many megabytes of data to
consider. We are investigating the exact form, but the intent is to change
the serialisation of inventories so that comparing two inventories can be
done in some smaller time - e.g. O(log N) scaling. Whatever form this takes,
a repository that can export it directly will be able to perform operations
between two historical trees much more efficiently than the current
repositories.</p></li>
<li><p>Greatest distance from origin cache. This is a possible change to introduce,
but it may be unnecessary - listed here for completeness till it has been
established as [un]needed.</p></li>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20"><span class="sectnum">1.1.2</span> Integration of performance changes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#integration-of-performance-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>To deliver a version of bzr with all our planned changes will require
significant integration work. Minimally each change needs to integrate with
some aspect of the bzr version itâs merged into, but in reality many of these
changes while conceptually independent will in fact have to integrate with the
other changes we have planned before can have a completed system.</p>
<p>Additionally changes that alter disk formats are inherently more tricky to
integrate because we will often need to alter apis throughout the code base to
expose the increased or reduced model of the preferred disk format.</p>
<p>You can generate a graph <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">performance.png</span></code> in the source tree from
Graphviz âdotâ file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">performance.dot</span></code>.  This graphs out the dependencies
to let us make accurate assessments of the changes needed in terms of code
and API, hopefully minimising the number of different integration steps we
have to take, while giving us a broad surface area for development. Itâs
based on a summary in the next section of this document of the planned
changes with their expected collaborators and dependencies. Where a
command is listed, the expectation is that all uses of that command -
local, remote, dumb transport and smart transport are being addressed
together.</p>
<p>The following provides a summary of the planned changes and their expected
collaborators within the code base, along with an estimate of whether they are
likely to require changes to their collaborators to be considered âfinishedâ.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use case target APIs: Each of these is likely to alter the Tree interface.
Some few of them focus on Branch and will alter Branch and Repository
accordingly. As they are targeted APIs we can deep changes all the way down
the stack to the underlying representation to make it all fit well.
Presenting a top level API for many things will be possible now as long as
the exposed data is audited for things we plan to make optional, or remove:
Such things cannot be present in the final API. Writing these APIs now will
provide strong feedback to the design process for those things which are
considered optional or removable, so these APIs should be implemented
before removing or making optional existing data.</p></li>
<li><p>Deprecating versioned files as a supported API: This collaborates with the
Repository API but can probably be done by adding a replacement API for
places where the versioned-file api is used. We may well want to keep a
concept of âa file over timeâ or âinventories over timeâ, so the existing
repository model of exposing versioned file objects may be ok; what we need
to ensure we do is remove the places in the code base where you create or
remove or otherwise describe manipulation of the storage by knit rather than
talking at the level of file ids and revision ids. The current
versioned-file API would be a burden for implementors of a blob based
repository format, so the removal of callers, and deprecation of those parts
of the API should be done before creating a blob based repository format.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a revision validator: Revision validators may depend on storage
layer changes to inventories so while we can create a revision validator
API, we cannot create the final one until we have the inventory structural
changes completed.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotation caching API: This API is a prerequisite for new repository
formats. If written after they are introduced we may find that the
repository is lacking in functionality, so the API should be implemented
first.</p></li>
<li><p>_iter_changes based merging: If the current _iter_changes_ API is
insufficient, we should know about that before designing the disk format for
generating fast _iter_changes_ output.</p></li>
<li><p>Network-efficient revision graph API: This influences what questions we will
want to ask a local repository very quickly; as such itâs a driver for the
new repository format and should be in place first if possible. Itâs probably
not sufficiently different to local operations to make this a hard ordering
though.</p></li>
<li><p>Working tree disk ordering: Knowing the expected order for disk operations
may influence the needed use case specific APIs, so having a solid
understanding of what is optimal - and why - and whether it is pessimal on
non-Linux-kernel platforms is rather important.</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to version files greater than memory in size: This cannot be
achieved until all parts of the library which deal with user files are able
to provide access to files larger than memory. Many strategies can be
considered for this - such as temporary files on disk, memory mapping etc.
We should have enough of a design laid out that developers of repository and
tree logic are able to start exposing apis, and considering requirements
related to them, to let this happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Per-file graph access API: This should be implemented on top of or as part
of the newer API for accessing data about a file over time. It can be a
separate step easily; but as itâs in the same area of the library should not
be done in parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>Repository stacking API: The key dependency/change required for this is that
repositories must individually be happy with having partial data - e.g. many
ghosts. However the way the API needs to be used should be driven from the
command layer in, because itâs unclear at the moment what will work best.</p></li>
<li><p>Revision stream API: This API will become clear as we streamline commands.
On the data insertion side commit will want to generate new data. The
commands pull, bundle, merge, push, possibly uncommit will want to copy
existing data in a streaming fashion.</p></li>
<li><p>New container format: Itâs hard to tell what the right way to structure the
layering is. Probably having smooth layering down to the point that code
wants to operate on the containers directly will make this more clear. As
bundles will become a read-only branch &amp; repository, the smart server wants
streaming-containers, and we are planning a pack based repository, it
appears that we will have three different direct container users. However,
the bundle user may in fact be fake - because it really is a repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Separation of annotation cache: Making the disk changes to achieve this
depends on the new API being created. Bundles probably want to be
annotation-free, so they are a form of implementation of this and will need
the on-demand annotation facility.</p></li>
<li><p>Repository operation disk ordering: Dramatically changing the ordering of
disk operations requires a new repository format. We have most of the
analysis done to be able to specify the desired ordering, so it should be
possible to write such a format now based on the container logic, but
without any of the inventory representation or delta representation changes.
This would for instance involve pack combining ordering the existing diffs
in reverse order.</p></li>
<li><p>Inventory representation: This has a dependency on what data is
dropped from the core and what is kept. Without those changes being known we
can implement a new representation, but it wonât be a final one. One of the
services the new inventory representation is expected to deliver is one of
validators for subtrees â a means of comparing just subtrees of two
inventories without comparing all the data within that subtree.</p></li>
<li><p>Delta storage optimisation: This has a strict dependency on a new repository
format. Optimisation takes many forms - we probably cannot complete the
desired optimisations under knits though we could use xdelta within a
knit-variation.</p></li>
<li><p>Greatest distance from origin cache: The potential users of this exist
today, it is likely able to be implemented immediately, but we are not sure
that its needed anymore, so it is being shelved.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing derivable data: Itâs very hard to do this while the derived data is
exposed in APIâs but not used by commands. Implemented the targeted APIâs
for our core use cases should allow use to remove accidental use of derived
data, making only explicit uses of it visible, and isolating the impact of
removing it : allowing us to experiment sensibly. This covers both dropping
the per-file merge graph and the hash-based-names proposals.</p></li>

<p>The analysis needs to be able to define the characteristics of the
involved disk storage and APIs. That means we need to examine the data
required for the operation, in what order it is required, on both the
read and write sides, and how that needs to be presented to be
consistent with our layering.</p>
<p>As a quick example: âannotation of a file requires the file id looked up
from the tree, the basis revision id from the tree, and then the text of
that fileid-revisionid pair along with the creating revision id
allocated to each line, and the dotted revision number of each of those
revision ids.â All three of our key domain objects are involved here,
but we havenât defined any characteristics of the api or disk facilities
yet. We could then do that by saying something like âthe file-id lookup
should degrade gracefully as trees become huge. The tree basis id should
be constant time. Retrieval of the annotated text should be roughly
constant for any text of the same size regardless of the number of
revisions contributing to its content. Mapping of the revision ids to
dotted revnos could be done as the text is retrieved, but itâs completely
fine to post-process the annotated text to obtain dotted-revnos.â</p>

<p>Obviously, those that will make for an extremely fast system :). There
are many possible factors, but the ones I think are most interesting to
design with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>baseline overhead:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The time to get bzr ready to begin the use case.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>scaling: how does performance change when any of the follow aspects
of the system are ratcheted massively up or down:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>number of files/dirs/symlinks/subtrees in a tree (both working and
revision trees)</p></li>
<li><p>size of any particular file</p></li>
<li><p>number of elements within a single directory</p></li>
<li><p>length of symlinks</p></li>
<li><p>number of changes to any file over time
(subordinately also the number of merges of the file)</p></li>
<li><p>number of commits in the ancestry of a branch
(subordinately also the number of merges)</p></li>
<li><p>number of revisions in a repository</p></li>
<li><p>number of fileids in a repository</p></li>
<li><p>number of ghosts in a given graph (revision or per-file)</p></li>
<li><p>number of branches in a repository</p></li>
<li><p>number of concurrent readers for a tree/branch/repository</p></li>
<li><p>number of concurrent writers for objects that support that.</p></li>
<li><p>latency to perform file operations (e.g. slow disks, network file systems,
our VFS layer and FTP/SFTP/etc)</p></li>
<li><p>bandwidth to the disk storage</p></li>
<li><p>latency to perform semantic operations (hpss specific)</p></li>
<li><p>bandwidth when performing semantic operations.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>locality of reference: If an operation requires data that is located
within a small region at any point, we often get better performance
than with an implementation of the same operation that requires the
same amount of data but with a lower locality of reference. Itâs
fairly tricky to add locality of reference after the fact, so I think
its worth considering up front.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using these factors, to the annotate example we can add that its
reasonable to do two âsemanticâ round trips to the local tree, one to
the branch object, and two to the repository. In file-operation level
measurements, in an ideal world there would be no more than one round
trip for each semantic operation. What there must not be is one round
trip per revision involved in the revisionid-&gt;dotted number mapping, nor
per each revision id attributed to a line in the text.</p>
<p>Not all the items mentioned above are created equal. The analysis should
include the parameters considered and the common case values for each - the
optimisation should be around the common cases not around the exceptions.</p>
<p>For instance, we have a smart server now; file level operations are relatively
low latency and we should use that as the common case. At this point we intend
to preserve the performance of the dumb protocol networking, but focus on
improving network performance via the smart server and thus escape the
file-level operation latency considerations.</p>
<p>Many performance problems only become visible when changing the scaling knobs
upwards to large trees. On small trees itâs our baseline performance that drives
incremental improvements; on large trees itâs the amount of processing per item
that drives performance. A significant goal therefore is to keep the amount of
data to be processed under control. Ideally we can scale in a sublinear fashion
for all operations, but we MUST NOT scale even linearly for operations that
invoke a latency multiplier. For example, reading a file on disk requires
finding the inode for the file, then the block with the data and returning the
contents. Due to directory grouping logic we pay a massive price to read files
if we do not group the reads of files within the same directory.</p>

<p>We could do this in two manners: determine revisions to sync and signatures to sync in two passes, or change the âvalueâ of a revision implicitly when the signature is different. E.g. by using merkle hash trees with the signature data a separate component the signatures will naturally be identified to sync.</p>
<p>We want to only exchange data proportional to the number of new revisions and
signatures in the system though. One way to achieve this for revisions is to
walk the graph out from the desired tips until the surface area intersection is
found. For signatures a set difference seems to be needed as there is no DAG of signatures: the presence of one has no implications on the presence of another, so a full pass over the set of signatures would be required to confirm no new signatures are needed (let alone replaced signatures).</p>
<p>IFF we can determine ânew revisionsâ and ânew signaturesâ without full graph access then we can scale acceptable for push and pull.</p>
<p>Ghosts are revisions which are not present in a particular repository. Filling ghosts refers to removing ghosts in the target repository when the ghost is present in the source repository. Filling ghosts can be either an explicit or implicit action. The common case is no ghosts.</p>

<p>A set synchronisation approach is one which synchronises two sets without
regard for innate structure. This can be very efficient but requires adding a
new node to be processed with every commit. Caching of the results of the
various set based syncs Iâve seen is possible but because the data structures
look different depending on the tip revision being synced up to the cache needs
to be very complex. I recommend not using such an approach for the common case
pull because of the failure to scale. We can use such an approach for
synchronisation of new signatures and ghosts, which should be an explicit
option in both cases.</p>

<p>A DAG based approach to synchronistion is one that uses the DAG structure to
determine the difference in present nodes. It can as a result operate from the
tip of the DAG backwards. A dag based approach should allow incremental access
to data and not require a full-graph scan for incremental operations.</p>

<p>We should read roughly as much of the revision level graph as is needed from
each repository to determine the node difference.  If requested we should
perform a detailed scan to pick up ghost revisions and revisions which have had
signatures added. This should not be the default as it requires full history
access in both cases.</p>

<p>New data written to a repository should be completed intact when it is made
visible. This suggests that either all the data for a revision must be made
atomically visible (e.g. by renaming a single file) or the leaf nodes of the
reference graph must become visible first.</p>
<p>Data is referred to via the following graph:
revision -&gt; revision
revision -&gt; signature
revision -&gt; inventory
inventory -&gt; fileid:revisionid
fileid:revisionid -&gt; fileid:revisionid</p>
<p>Data is verifiable via a different ordering:
signature -&gt; revision -&gt; inventory -&gt; fileid:revisionid texts.</p>
<p>We dont gpg verify each revision today; this analysis only speaks to hash
verification of contents.</p>
<p>To validate a revision we need to validate the data it refers to. But to
validate the contents of a revision we need the new texts in the inventory for
the revision - to check a fileid:revisionid we need to know the expected sha1
of the full text and thus also need to read the delta chain to construct the
text as we accept it to determine if itâs valid. Providing separate validators
for the chosen representation would address this.
e.g: For an inventory entry FILEID:REVISIONID we store the validator of the
full text :SHA1:. If we also stored the validator of the chosen disk
representation (:DELTASHA1:) we could validate the transmitted representation
without expanding the delta in the common case. If that failed we could expand
the delta chain and try against the full text validator, and finally fail. As
different delta generators might generate different deltas, :DELTASHA1: should
not become part of the revision validator, only the inventory disk encoding. In
a related manner a transmission format that allowed cheap validation of content
without applying locally stored deltas would be advantageous because no local
reads would be incurred to validate new content. For instance, always sending a
full text for any file, possibly with a delta-chain when transmitting multiple
revisionids of the file, would allow this. (git pack-files have this property).</p>

<p>A single-file local format would allow safe atomic addition of data while
allowing optimisal transmission order of data. Failing this the validation of
data should be tuned to not require reading local texts during data addition

<p>Phase two is to have better interfaces by which a good workingtree format

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id111"><span class="sectnum">1.3.4.2</span> Commit: The Minimum Work Required</a><a class="headerlink" href="#commit-the-minimum-work-required" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a description of the minimum work that commit must do.  We
want to make sure that our design doesnât cost too much more than this
minimum.  I am trying to do this without making too many assumptions
about the underlying storage, but am assuming that the ui and basic
architecture (wt, branch, repo) stays about the same.</p>
<p>The basic purpose of commit is to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>create and store a new revision based on the contents of the working tree</p></li>
<li><p>make this the new basis revision for the working tree</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can do a selected commit of only some files or subtrees.</p>
<p>The best performance we could hope for is:
- stat each versioned selected working file once
- read from the workingtree and write into the repository any new file texts
- in general, do work proportional to the size of the shape (eg
inventory) of the old and new selected trees, and to the total size of
the modified files</p>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<p>1.0 - Store new file texts: if a versioned file contains a new text
there is no avoiding storing it.  To determine which ones have changed
we must go over the workingtree and at least stat each file.  If the
file is modified since it was last hashed, it must be read in.
Ideally we would read it only once, and either notice that it has not
changed, or store it at that point.</p>
<p>On the other hand we want new code to be able to handle files that are
larger than will fit in memory.  We may then need to read each file up
to two times: once to determine if there is a new text and calculate
its hash, and again to store it.</p>
<p>1.1 - Store a tree-shape description (ie inventory or similar.)  This
describes the non-file objects, and provides a reference from the
Revision to the texts within it.</p>
<p>1.2 - Generate and store a new revision object.</p>
<p>1.3 - Do delta-compression on the stored objects.  (git notably does
not do this at commit time, deferring this entirely until later.)
This requires finding the appropriate basis for each modified file: in
the current scheme we get the file id, last-revision from the
dirstate, look into the knit for that text, extract that text in
total, generate a delta, then store that into the knit.  Most delta
operations are O(n**2) to O(n**3) in the size of the modified files.</p>
<p>1.4 - Cache annotation information for the changes: at the moment this
is done as part of the delta storage.  There are some flaws in that
approach, such as that it is not updated when ghosts are filled, and
the annotation canât be re-run with new diff parameters.</p>
<p>2.1 - Make the new revision the basis for the tree, and clear the list
of parents.  Strictly this is all thatâs logically necessary, unless
the working tree format requires more work.</p>
<p>The dirstate format does require more work, because it caches the
parent tree data for each file within the working tree data.  In
practice this means that every commit rewrites the entire dirstate
file - we could try to avoid rewriting the whole file but this may be
difficult because variable-length data (the last-changed revision id)
is inserted into many rows.</p>
<p>The current dirstate design then seems to mean that any commit of a
single file imposes a cost proportional to the size of the current
workingtree.  Maybe there are other benefits that outweigh this.
Alternatively if it was fast enough for operations to always look at
the original storage of the parent trees we could do without the
cache.</p>
<p>2.2 - Record the observed file hashes into the workingtree control
files.  For the files that we just committed, we have the information
to store a valid hash cache entry: we know their stat information and
the sha1 of the file contents.  This is not strictly necessary to the
speed of commit, but it will be useful later in avoiding reading those
files, and the only cost of doing it now is writing it out.</p>
<p>In fact there are some user interface niceties that complicate this:</p>
<p>3 - Before starting the commit proper, we prompt for a commit message
and in that commit message editor we show a list of the files that
will be committed: basically the output of brz status.  This is
basically the same as the list of changes we detect while storing the
commit, but because the user will sometimes change the tree after
opening the commit editor and expect the final state to be committed I
think we do have to look for changes twice.  Since it takes the user a
while to enter a message this is not a big problem as long as both the
status summary and the commit are individually fast.</p>
<p>4 - As the commit proceeds (or after?) we show another status-like
summary.  Just printing the names of modified files as theyâre stored
would be easy.  Recording deleted and renamed files or directories is
more work: this can only be done by reference to the primary parent
tree and requires it be read in.  Worse, reporting renames requires
searching by id across the entire parent tree.   Possibly full
reporting should be a default-off verbose option because it does
require more work beyond the commit itself.</p>
<p>5 - Bazaar currently allows for missing files to be automatically
marked as removed at the time of commit.  Leaving aside the ui
consequences, this means that we have to update the working inventory
to mark these files as removed.  Since as discussed above we always
have to rewrite the dirstate on commit this is not substantial, though
we should make sure we do this in one pass, not two.  I have
previously proposed to make this behaviour a non-default option.</p>
<p>We may need to run hooks or generate signatures during commit, but
they donât seem to have substantial performance consequences.</p>
<p>If one wanted to optimize solely for the speed of commit I think
hash-addressed  file-per-text storage like in git (or Breezy 0.1) is very
good.  Remarkably, it does not need to read the inventory for the
previous revision.  For each versioned file, we just need to get its
hash, either by reading the file or validating its stat data.  If that
hash is not already in the repository, the file is just copied in and
compressed.  As directories are traversed, theyâre turned into texts
and stored as well, and then finally the revision is too.  This does
depend on later doing some delta compression of these texts.</p>
<p>Variations on this are possible.  Rather than writing a single file

<p>At first glance, commit simply stores the changes status reports. In fact,
this isnât technically correct: commit considers some files modified that
status does not. The notes below were put together by John Arbash Meinel
and Aaron Bentley in May 2007 to explain the finer details of commit to
Ian Clatworthy. They are recorded here as they are likely to be useful to
others new to Bazaar â¦</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Unknown files have a different effect.</strong> With âno-strict (the default)
they have no effect and can be completely ignored. With âstrict they
should cause the commit to abort (so you donât forget to add the two new
test files that you just created).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple parents.</strong> âstatusâ always compares 2 trees, typically the

<li><p>The âlast modifiedâ property for files.
A file may be marked as changed since the last commit, but that
change may have come in from the merge, and the change could have
happened several commits back. There are several edge cases to be
handled here, like if both branches modified the same file, or if
just one branch modified it.</p></li>
<li><p>The trickier case is when a file appears unmodified since last
commit, but it was modified versus one of the merged branches. I
believe there are a few ways this can happen, like if a merged
branch changes a file and then reverts it back (you still update
the âlast modifiedâ field).
In general, if both sides disagree on the âlast-modifiedâ flag,
then you need to generate a new entry pointing âlast-modifiedâ at
this revision (because you are resolving the differences between
the 2 parents).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Automatic deletion of âmissingâ files.</strong> This is a point that we go
back and forth on. I think the basic idea is that âbrz commitâ by
default should abort if it finds a âmissingâ file (in case that file was
renamed rather than deleted), but âbrz commit âautoâ can add unknown
files and remove missing files automatically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sha1 for newly added files.</strong> status doesnât really need this: it should
only care that the file is not present in base, but is present now. In
some ways commit doesnât care either, since it needs to read and sha the
file itself anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nested trees.</strong> status doesnât recurse into nested trees, but commit does.
This is just because not all of the nested-trees work has been merged yet.</p>
<p>A tree-reference is considered modified if the subtree has been
committed since the last containing-tree commit.  But commit needs to
recurse into every subtree, to ensure that a commit is done if the
subtree has changed since its last commit.  _iter_changes only reports
on tree-references that are modified, so it canât be used for doing
subtree commits.</p>

<p>_iter_changes wonât tell us about tree references that havenât changed,
even if those subtrees have changed.  (Unless we ask for unchanged

<p>There is an iter_references method, but using it looks just as expensive
as calling kind().</p>
<p>I did some work on updating commit to use iter_changes, but found for
multi-parent trees, I had to fall back to the slow inventory comparison
approach.</p>
<p>Really, I think we need a call akin to iter_changes that handles
multiple parents, and knows to emit entries when InventoryEntry.revision

<p>For each file, commit is currently doing more work than it should. Here is
Johnâs take on a better way â¦</p>
<p>Note that â_iter_changesâ <em>does</em> have to touch every path on disk, but
it just can do it in a more efficient manner. (It doesnât have to create
an InventoryEntry for all the ones that havenât changed).</p>
<p>I agree with Aaron that we need something a little different than
_iter_changes. Both because of handling multiple parents, as well as we
donât want it to actually read the files if we have a stat-cache miss.</p>
<p>Specifically, the commit code <em>has</em> to read the files because it is
going to add the text to the repository, and we want it to compute the
sha1 at <em>that</em> time, so we are guaranteed to have the valid sha (rather
than just whatever the last cached one was). So we want the code to
return âNoneâ if it doesnât have an up-to-date sha1, rather than reading
the file and computing it, just before it returns it to the parent.</p>
<p>The commit code (0.16) should really be restructured. Itâs layering is
pretty wrong.</p>
<p>Specifically, calling âkind()â requires a stat of the file. But we have
to do a stat to get the size/whether the record is up-to-date, etc. So
we really need to have a âcreate_an_up_to_date_inventory()â function.
But because we are accessing every object on disk, we want to be working
in tuples rather than Inventory objects. And because DirState already
has the parent records next to the current working inventory, it can do
all the work to do really fast comparison and throw-away of unimportant
records.</p>
<p>The way I made âbrz statusâ fast is by moving the âignore this recordâ
ability as deep into the stack as I could get. Status has the property
that you donât care about most of the records, just like commit. So the
sooner you can stop evaluating the 99% that you donât care about, the
less work you do.</p>

<p>We would like to avoid the work of reading any data about the parent
revisions.  We should at least try to avoid reading anything from the
repository; we can also consider whether it is possible or useful to hold
less parent information in the working tree.</p>
<p>When a commit of selected files is requested, the committed snapshot is a
composite of some directories from the parent revision and some from the
working tree.  In this case it is logically necessary to have the parent
inventory information.</p>
<p>If file last-change information or per-file graph information is stored
then it must be available from the parent trees.</p>
<p>If the Branchâs storage method does delta compression at commit time it
may need to retrieve file or inventory texts from the repository.</p>
<p>It is desirable to avoid roundtrips to the Repository during commit,
particularly because it may be remote.  If the WorkingTree can determine
by itself that a text was in the parent and therefore should be in the
Repository that avoids one roundtrip per file.</p>
<p>There is a possibility here that the parent revision is not stored, or not
correctly stored, in the repository the tree is being committed into, and
so the committed tree would not be reconstructable.  We could check that
the parent revision is present in the inventory and rely on the invariant
that if a revision is present, everything to reconstruct it will be
present too.</p>

<p>Bazaar (as of 0.17) does not support selective-file commit of a merge;
this could be done if we decide how it should be recorded - is this to be
stored as an overall merge revision; as a preliminary non-merge revisions;
or will the per-file graph diverge from the revision graph.</p>
<p>There are several checks that may cause the commit to be refused, which
may be activated or deactivated by options.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>presence of conflicts in the tree</p></li>
<li><p>presence of unknown files</p></li>
<li><p>the working tree basis is up to date with the branch tip</p></li>
<li><p>the local branch is up to date with the master branch, if there
is one and âlocal is not specified</p></li>
<li><p>an empty commit message is given,</p></li>
<li><p>a hook flags an error</p></li>
<li><p>a âpointlessâ commit, with no inventory changes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these require walking the tree and can be easily done while
recording the tree shape.  This does require that it be possible to abort
the commit after the tree changes have been recorded.  It could be ok to
either leave the unreachable partly-committed records in the repository,
or to roll back.</p>
<p>Other complications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>when automatically adding new files or deleting missing files during
commit, they must be noted during commit and written into the working
tree at some point</p></li>
<li><p>refuse âpointlessâ commits with no file changes - should be easy by
just refusing to do the final step of storing a new overall inventory

<li><p>heuristic detection of renames between add and delete (out of scope for
this change)</p></li>
<li><p>pushing changes to a master branch if any</p></li>
<li><p>running hooks, pre and post commit</p></li>
<li><p>prompting for a commit message if necessary, including a list of the

<li><p>For trees (eg dirstate) that cache parent inventories, the old parent

<p>There will be different implementations of this for different Branch
classes, whether for foreign branches or Bazaar repositories using
different storage methods.</p>
<p>Most of the commit should occur during a single lockstep iteration across
the workingtree and parent trees.  The WorkingTree interface needs to
provide methods that give commit all it needs.  Some of these methods
(such as answering the fileâs last change revision) may be deprecated in
newer working trees and there we have a choice of either calculating the
value from the data that is present, or refusing to support commit to
newer repositories.</p>
<p>For a dirstate tree the iteration of changes from the parent can easily be
done within its own iter_changes.</p>
<p>Dirstate inventories may be most easily updated in a single operation at
the end; however it may be best to accumulate data as we proceed through
the tree rather than revisiting it at the end.</p>
<p>Showing a progress bar for commit may not be necessary if we report files
as they are committed.  Alternatively we could transiently show a progress
bar for each directory thatâs scanned, even if no changes are observed.</p>
<p>This needs to collect a list of added/changed/removed files, each of which
must have its text stored (if any) and containing directory updated.  This
can be done by calling Tree._iter_changes on the source tree, asking for
changes</p>
<p>In the 0.17 model the commit operation needs to know the per-file parents
and per-file last-changed revision.</p>
<p>(In this and other operations we must avoid having multiple layers walk
over the tree separately.  For example, it is no good to have the Command
layer walk the tree to generate a list of all file ids to commit, because
the tree will also be walked later.  The layers that do need to operate
per-file should probably be bound together in a per-dirblock iterator,
rather than each iterating independently.)</p>

<p>The Branch commit code needs to ask the Tree what should be committed, in
terms of changes from the parent revisions.  If the Tree holds all the
necessary parent tree information itself it can do it single handed;
otherwise it may need to ask the Repository for parent information.</p>
<p>This should be a streaming interface, probably like iter_changes returning
information per directory block.</p>
<p>The interface should not return a block for directories that are
recursively unchanged.</p>
<p>The treeâs idea of what is possibly changed may be more conservative than
that of the branch.  For example the tree may report on merges of files
where the text is identical to the parents: this must be recorded for
Bazaar branches that record per-file ancestry but is not necessary for all
branches.  If the tree is responsible for determining when directories
have been recursively modified then it will report on all the parents of
such files.  There are several implementation options:</p>
<p>1. Return all files and directories the branch might want to commit, even
if the branch ends up taking no action on them.</p>
<p>2. When starting the iteration, the branch can specify what type of change
is considered interesting.</p>
<p>Since these types of changes are probably (??) rare compared to files that
are either completely unmodified or substantially modified, the first may
be the best and simplest option.</p>
<p>The branch needs to build an inventory to commit, which must include
unchanged files within changed directories.  This should be returned from
the working tree too.  Repositories that store per-directory inventories
will want to build and store these from the lowest directories up.
For 0.17 format repositories with an all-in-one inventory it may be
easiest to accumulate inventory entries in arbitrary order into an
in-memory Inventory and then serialize it.</p>
<p>It ought to be possible to commit any Tree into a Branch, without
requiring a WorkingTree; the commit code should cope if the tree is not
interested in updating hashcache information or does not have a

<p>After the commit the tree needs to be updated to the new revision.  Some
information which was accumulated during the commit must be made available

scales O(n^2) with the number of lines in the file.  Therefore, it
is worthwile to avoid content comparisons as much as possible.</p>
<p>Our current knit format contains content comparisons, and this data can
be converted into lists of matching blocks.  Other future formats such as
mpdiff may also support such conversion.  So it is possible to reuse past
comparisons.</p>
<p>It is also possible to combine sequential comparisons.  So given a comparison
of âfooâ to âbarâ, and âbarâ to âbazâ, it is possible to derive a comparison of
âfooâ to âbazâ.</p>
<p>Reuse of historical comparisons will scale with the number of uncommon
build-parents between the two historical revisions.  This will typically be
proportional to the amount of change that the file has undergone.  Therefore,
in the common case, reuse of historical comparisons will scale with the
amount of change.</p>
<p>The downside of such reuse is that it ties the comparison to the historical
data.  But given the performance improvement, it seems to be worth
consideration.  Fresh comparisons can be performed if the user requests them.</p>
<p>It may also be possible to accelerate comparisons by including annotation data,
thus increasing the number of unique lines.</p>

<p>This operation should be strictly proportional to the amount of change, because
a comparison has already been done at commit time.  Achieving that performance
requires the committed data to be properly structured, so that the comparison

<p>This must scale with the number of versioned files, unless the user indicates
that only certain files should be compared.</p>
<p>Performance can be further improved by caching comparisons to avoid repeating
them.  Caching could potentially be performed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code> and perhaps by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">merge</span></code>.  Merge is aware of the relationship of a text mergeâs result to
the THIS value, and the THIS value is generally the basis value.  So the
comparison is latent, but present.  The only issue is extracting it.</p>
<p>The cache could be indexed by sha1sum pairs.  It could also be indexed by
file-id, to facilitate removal of stale data.</p>

<p>We should be able to do work proportional to the scope the user is reverting
and the amount of changes between the working tree and the revision being
reverted to.</p>
<p>This depends on being able to compare unchanged subtrees without recursing so that the mapping of paths to revert to ids to revert can be done efficiently. Specifically we should be able to avoid getting the transitive closure of directory contents when mapping back to paths from ids at the start of revert.</p>
<p>One way this might work is to:
for the selected scopes, for each element in the wt:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. get hash tree data for that scope.
1. get ânew enoughâ hash data for the siblings of the scope: it can be out of date as long as itâs not older than the last move or rename out of that siblings scope.
1. Use the hash tree data to tune the work done in finding matching paths/ids which are different in the two trees.</p>

eliminate accessing or considering subtrees regardless of historival
age. However, if we have had to access the historical tree shape to
perform path selection this rather reduces the win we can obtain here.
If we can cause path expansion to not require historical shape access
(perhaps by performing the expansion after calculating the tree
difference for the top level of the selected path) then we can gain a
larger win. This strongly suggests that path expansion and tree
difference generation should be linked in terms of API.</p></li>

<p>There appear to be three basic ways of generating annotations:</p>
<p>If the annotation works by asking the storage layer for successive full texts
then the scaling of this will be proportional to the time to diff throughout
the history of thing being annotated.</p>
<p>If the annotation works by asking the storage layer for successive deltas
within the history of the thing being annotated we believe we can make it scale
broadly proportional to the depth of the tree of revisions of the annotated
object.</p>
<p>If the annotation works by combining cached annotations such that creating a
full text recreates annotations for it then it will scale with the cost of
obtaining that text.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that for a directory in a tree (committed or otherwise), we
will have a single scalar value.  If these values are the same, the contents of
the subtree under that directory are necessarily the same.</p>
<p>This is intended to help with these use cases, by allowing them to quickly skip
over directories with no relevant changes, and to detect when a directory has
changed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>diff/status (both local trees and historical trees)</p></li>
<li><p>merge</p></li>
<li><p>log -v</p></li>
<li><p>log on a directory</p></li>
<li><p>commit</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of this will be hidden behind the Tree interface.  This should cover
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">log</span> <span class="pre">-v</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">status</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">merge</span></code> (and implicit merge during

<p>Commit is similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iter_changes</span></code>, but different because it needs to
compare to all the trees.  Commit currently needs to compare the working
tree to all the parent trees, which is needed to update the last_modified
field and would be unnecessary if we removed that field (for both files
and directories) and did not store per-file graphs.
This would potentially speed up commit after merge.</p>
<p>Verbose commit also displays the merged files, which does
require looking at all parents of files that arenât identical
to the left-hand parent.</p>

<p>Log is interested in two operations: finding the revisions that touched
anything inside a directory, and getting the differences between
consecutive revisions (possibly filtered to a directory):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">find_touching_revisions</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">branch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">file_id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># should be on Branch?</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Log shows the revisions that merged a change.  At the moment that is not
included in the per-file graph, and it would also not be visible if the
directories were hashed.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id144"><span class="sectnum">1.4.1.3</span> Open questions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#open-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Is this a good idea at all?</p>
<p>If changing a file changes all its parent directories up to the root it
will cause more churn on commit.  (We currently update the all-in-one
inventory, but only have to update one line of it.)</p>
<p>Every time a child changes, weâll get a new node in the per-directory
graph.  This is generally useful: it allows bzr log to do the default
mode easily, which is to show all changes under that directory.  The
less common operation, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">log</span> <span class="pre">--no-recursive</span></code> is still possible by
looking only at when the directory itself was renamed, added or removed.
(That is what the directory graph describes in bzr 0.18 and it is rarely
useful.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should these be hashes or revision ids or something else?</p>
<p>Pros of using hashes: hashes are easy to generate by a foreign branch
plugin (e.g. bzr-svn).  They donât need to get recursive last-changed
from the foreign branch, or to walk back through history.  They just
need the relevant directory state, which any system we support can
answer.</p>
<p>Hashes converge: if you modify and then modify back, you get the same
hash.  This is a pro because you can detect that there were ultimately
no significant changes.  And also a con: you cannot use these hashes to form a graph
because they get cycles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are the values unique across the whole tree, or only when comparing
different versions of the same object?</p>
<p>If we use last-changed revisions, then they will be very not unique
across the whole tree.  To look up the contents, you must pass a
composite key like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(file_id,</span> <span class="pre">last_changed)</span></code>.</p>
<p>If we use hashes they will be same only when the two contain the same
contents.  Since we say that file ids must be unique, this
means they will match if and only if they are empty.  We might relax
that in future when we introduce path tokens.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it reasonable to assume hashes wonât collide?</p>
<p>The odds of SHA-1 hashes colliding âaccidentallyâ are vanishingly small.</p>
<p>It is possible that a <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4270">preimage attack</a> against SHA-1 may be discovered
in the future.  Since weâre not proposing in this document to make
revision-ids be SHA-1, if SHA-1 was obsoleted then we could rewrite the
contents of revisions but would not need to rename revisions.  So the
impact of such a migration should just be a format upgrade, and a
recommendation (but not requirement) to re-sign revisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If we use hashes, should it be the hash of the
representation stored for a directory?</p>
<p>In other words, should we pun the representation of the directory with
the form used for validation.</p>
<p>If thereâs some data stored thatâs not in the hash itâs problematic.
The hash in no longer (effectively) uniquely identifies the
representation.</p>
<p>It is desirable that we have a hash that covers all data, to guard
against bugs, transmission errors, or users trying to hand-hack files.
Since we need one hash of everything in the tree, perhaps we should also
use it for the fingerprint.</p>
<p>Testaments explicitly separate the form used for hashing/signing from
the form used for storage.  This allows us to change the storage form
without breaking existing GPG signatures.  The downside is that we need
to do work O(tree) to make a testament, and this slows down signing,
verifying and generating bundles.  It also means that there is some
stored data which is not protected by the signature: this data is less
important, but corruption of it would still cause problems.
We have encountered some specific problems with disagreement between
inventories as to the last-change of files, which is currently unsigned.
These problems can be introduced by ghosts.</p>
<p>If we hash the representation, there is still a way to support old
signatures, assuming that we never discard irreplaceable information.
The signature should say what format it applies to (similar to
testaments), and we could transform in memory the tree back to that
format.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is hashing substantially slower than other possible approaches?</p>
<p>We already hash all the plain files.  Except in unusual cases, the
directory metadata will be substantially smaller: perhaps 200:1 as a
rule of thumb.</p>
<p>When building a bzr tree, we spend on the order of 100ms hashing all the
source lines to validate them (about 13MB of source).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can you calculate one from a directory in the working tree?  Without a basis?</p>
<p>This seems possible with either hashes or revision ids.</p>
<p>Using last_changed means that calculating the fingerprint from a working
tree necessarily requires reading the inventory for the basis
revision, so that we know when unchanged files were last changed.  With
hashes we could calculate them using the working tree information alone.
Itâs true that we will often then compare that information to the basis
tree (e.g. for simple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bzr</span> <span class="pre">diff</span></code>), but we may only have to compare at
the top level, and sometimes weâre comparing to a
different tree.  This also touches on whether we should store
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_modified</span></code> for files, rather than directories.</p>
<p>For revision ids we need to assign a value to use for uncommitted
changes, but see below about the problems of this.</p>
<p>In some ways it would be elegant to say (hypothetical):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">wt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_root</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_last_modified</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">branch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_last_revision</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to know that nothing was changed; but this may not be much better than</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">wt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_root</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_hash</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span>
  <span class="n">branch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_basis</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_root</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_hash</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Can you use this to compare (directories from) two working trees?</p>
<p>If you can generate it from a working tree, you should be able to use it
to compare them.</p>
<p>This does rule out for example using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_modified=None</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">='current:'</span></code> to mean âchanged in the working tree.â  Even if this is
not supported there seems some risk that we would get the same
fingerprint for trees that are actually different.</p>
<p>We could assign a
hypothetical revision id to the tree for uncommitted files.  In that
case there is some risk that the not-yet-committed id would become
visible or committed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can we use an âapproximate basisâ?</p>
<p>When using radix trees, you may need context beyond the specific
directory being compared.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can you get the fingerprint of parents directories with only selected file ids
taken from the working tree?</p>
<p>With hashes, weâd want to carry through the unselected files and
directories from the values they had in the parent revision.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are unbalanced trees a significant problem?  Trees can be unbalanced by having
many directories (deep or wide), or many files per directory.</p>
<p>For small trees like bzr, 744 of 874 are in the breezy subtree.  In
general, larger trees are more balanced, because humans, editors and
other tools have trouble managing very unbalanced trees.  But there are
exceptions: Aaron has one tree with 20,000 generated but versioned
entries in one directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should we use a radix tree approach where fingerprints are calculated on a synthetic
tree that is by definition balanced, even when the actual tree is unbalanced?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the specific advantages of using recursive-last-modified rather than
hashes?</p>
<p>It may be a smaller step change.</p>
<p>Itâs a bidirectional link: given a directory text identifier <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(file_id,</span>
<span class="pre">last_changed)</span></code> you can look up the revision that last changed it.</p>
<p>From the preceding, even without the per-file graph you can skip through
the history of this file: go to the last-changed revision, look at all
its parents and repeat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it a smaller change to use recursive-last-modified on directories?</p>
<p>Probably yes:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>We can just put it into the current inventory format without changing
anything else.</p>
<p>By contrast to use a hash weâd have to either split up the inventory
as stored, or change the sort order for the inventory, or synthesize
per-directory inventories in memory for hashing.</p>
<p>However, XML is somewhat redundant and slow to parse/generate; and
reading the whole thing before comparing some sections is only a
partial win.  It may be a smaller change but weâd be preserving
things we want to change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>At present we rarely hash storage representations, only file texts.
This is not a large technical change, but it is a conceptual change.
This has some consequences for how we can upgrade it in future: all
the changed directories need to be rewritten up to the revision level.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If we address directories by hash we need hash-addressed
storage.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If we address directories by hash then for consistency weâd probably
(not necessarily) want to address file texts by hash.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The per-file graph canât be indexed by hash because they can converge, so we
need to either rework or dispose of the per-file graph.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Any possibilities for avoiding hashes recurring?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Hash along with an identification of the parents (as in hg).  Then you
canât convert a tree without all its basis trees, and there is still
convergence when the same merge is done by two people, and you canât
create it directly from the working tree.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Include last-modified revision id in the hash.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Index by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(revision,</span> <span class="pre">hash)</span></code> or vice versa.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Store a per-file graph and allow it to have repeated keys.  The graph
would tell you about all the parent texts ever seen; you would need
to use revision graph information to resolve ambiguities.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What are the specific disadvantages of using recursive-last-modified rather than
hashes?</p>
<p>To calculate the last-changed revision, given the last-changed
information of the contained files, you need to look at the revision
graph.  Theyâre not enough because you need to know the relations
between the mentioned revisions.  In a merge itâs possible the correct
directory last-modified will not be the same as that of any of the files
within it.  This can also happen when a file is removed (deleted or
renamed) from a directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should we split up storage of the inventories?</p>
<p>This is not quite the same but connected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How does this relate to per-file/per-directory hashes?</p>
<p>If the version of a file or directory is identified by a hash, we canât
use that to point into a per-file graph.  We can have a graph indexed by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(file_id,</span> <span class="pre">hash,</span> <span class="pre">revision_id)</span></code>.  The last-modified could be stored as
part of this graph.</p>
<p>The graph would no longer be core data; it could be always present but
might be rebuilt.  Treating it as non-core data may make some changes
like shallow branches easier?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do you ask a tree for a given text?</p>
<p>Right now we say</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">revision_tree</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_file_lines</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>so the choice of storage is hidden behind the revision tree: it could be
accessed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(file_id,</span> <span class="pre">last_changed)</span></code> or by hash or otherwise.</p>
<p>At the moment the Repository exports a friend api to RevisionTree,
currently usually talking in VersionedFiles.</p>
<p>We probably wouldnât want Repository to expose a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_text_for_sha1()</span></code>
interface because that would be very difficult to support on old
repositories or on foreign branches.</p>
