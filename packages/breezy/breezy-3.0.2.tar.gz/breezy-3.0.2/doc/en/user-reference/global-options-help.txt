Global Options
==============


These options may be used with any command, and may appear in front of any
command.  (e.g. ``brz --profile help``).

--version      Print the version number. Must be supplied before the command.
--no-aliases   Do not process command aliases when running this command.
--builtin      Use the built-in version of a command, not the plugin version.
               This does not suppress other plugin effects.
--no-plugins   Do not process any plugins.
--no-l10n      Do not translate messages.
--concurrency  Number of processes that can be run concurrently (selftest).

--profile      Profile execution using the hotshot profiler.
--lsprof       Profile execution using the lsprof profiler.
--lsprof-file  Profile execution using the lsprof profiler, and write the
               results to a specified file.  If the filename ends with ".txt",
               text format will be used.  If the filename either starts with
               "callgrind.out" or end with ".callgrind", the output will be
               formatted for use with KCacheGrind. Otherwise, the output
               will be a pickle.
--coverage     Generate line coverage report in the specified directory.

-Oname=value   Override the ``name`` config option setting it to ``value`` for
               the duration of the command.  This can be used multiple times if
               several options need to be overridden.

information on profiling.

A number of debug flags are also available to assist troubleshooting and
development.  See :doc:`debug-flags-help`.
