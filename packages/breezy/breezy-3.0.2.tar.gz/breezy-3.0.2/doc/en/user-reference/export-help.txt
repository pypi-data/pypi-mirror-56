:Description:
  If no revision is specified this exports the last committed revision.
  
  Format may be an "exporter" name, such as tar, tgz, tbz2.  If none is
  given, try to find the format with the extension. If no extension
  is found exports to a directory (equivalent to --format=dir).
  
  If root is supplied, it will be used as the root directory inside
  container formats (tar, zip, etc). If it is not supplied it will default
  to the exported filename. The root option has no effect for 'dir' format.
  
  If branch is omitted then the branch containing the current working
  directory will be used.
  
  Note: Export of tree with non-ASCII filenames to zip is not supported.
