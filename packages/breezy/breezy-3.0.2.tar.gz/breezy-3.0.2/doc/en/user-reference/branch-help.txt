branch
======

:Purpose: Create a new branch that is a copy of an existing branch.
:Usage:   brz branch FROM_LOCATION [TO_LOCATION]

:Options:
  --bind                Bind new branch to from location.
  --files-from=ARG      Get file contents from this tree.
  --hardlink            Hard-link working tree files where possible.
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  --no-tree             Create a branch without a working-tree.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  -r ARG, --revision=ARG
                        See "help revisionspec" for details.
  --stacked             Create a stacked branch referring to the source
                        branch. The new branch will depend on the availability
                        of the source branch for all operations.
  --standalone          Do not use a shared repository, even if available.
  --switch              Switch the checkout in the current directory to the
                        new branch.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  --use-existing-dir    By default branch will fail if the target directory
                        exists, but does not already have a control directory.
                        This flag will allow branch to proceed.
  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

:Description:
  If the TO_LOCATION is omitted, the last component of the FROM_LOCATION will
  be used.  In other words, "branch ../foo/bar" will attempt to create ./bar.
  If the FROM_LOCATION has no / or path separator embedded, the TO_LOCATION
  is derived from the FROM_LOCATION by stripping a leading scheme or drive
  identifier, if any. For example, "branch lp:foo-bar" will attempt to
  create ./foo-bar.
  
  To retrieve the branch as of a particular revision, supply the --revision
  parameter, as in "branch foo/bar -r 5".
