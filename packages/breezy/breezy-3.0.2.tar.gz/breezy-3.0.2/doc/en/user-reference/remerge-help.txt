remerge
=======

:Purpose: Redo a merge.
:Usage:   brz remerge [FILE...]

:Options:
  -h, --help          Show help message.
  -q, --quiet         Only display errors and warnings.
  --reprocess         Reprocess to reduce spurious conflicts.
  --show-base         Show base revision text in conflicts.
  --usage             Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose       Display more information.

  Merge algorithm:
    --merge-type=ARG  Select a particular merge algorithm.
    --diff3           Merge using external diff3.
    --lca             LCA-newness merge.
    --merge3          Native diff3-style merge.
    --weave           Weave-based merge.

:Description:
  Use this if you want to try a different merge technique while resolving
  conflicts.  Some merge techniques are better than others, and remerge
  lets you try different ones on different files.
  
  The options for remerge have the same meaning and defaults as the ones for
  merge.  The difference is that remerge can (only) be run when there is a
  pending merge, and it lets you specify particular files.

:Examples:
    Re-do the merge of all conflicted files, and show the base text in
    conflict regions, in addition to the usual THIS and OTHER texts::

        brz remerge --show-base

    Re-do the merge of "foobar", using the weave merge algorithm, with
    additional processing to reduce the size of conflict regions::

        brz remerge --merge-type weave --reprocess foobar
