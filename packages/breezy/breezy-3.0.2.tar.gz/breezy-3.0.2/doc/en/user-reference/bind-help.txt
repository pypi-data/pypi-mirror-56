:Description:
  If no branch is supplied, rebind to the last bound location.
  
  Once converted into a checkout, commits must succeed on the master branch

  Bound branches use the nickname of its master branch unless it is set
  locally, in which case binding will update the local nickname to be
  that of the master.
