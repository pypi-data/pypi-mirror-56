                        options.

:Description:
  Display the active value for option NAME.
  
  If --all is specified, NAME is interpreted as a regular expression and all
  matching options are displayed mentioning their scope and without resolving
  option references in the value). The active value that bzr will take into
  account is the first one displayed for each option.
  
  If NAME is not given, --all .* is implied (all options are displayed for the
  current scope).
  
  Setting a value is achieved by using NAME=value without spaces. The value
  is set in the most relevant scope and can be checked by displaying the
  option again.
  
  Removing a value is achieved by using --remove NAME.
