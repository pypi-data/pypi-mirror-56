mv
==

:Purpose: Move or rename a file.
:Usage:
    brz mv OLDNAME NEWNAME

    brz mv SOURCE... DESTINATION


:Options:
  --after        Move only the brz identifier of the file, because the file
                 has already been moved.
  --auto         Automatically guess renames.
  --dry-run      Avoid making changes when guessing renames.
  -h, --help     Show help message.
  -q, --quiet    Only display errors and warnings.
  --usage        Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose  Display more information.

:Description:
  If the last argument is a versioned directory, all the other names
  are moved into it.  Otherwise, there must be exactly two arguments
  and the file is changed to a new name.
  
  If OLDNAME does not exist on the filesystem but is versioned and
  NEWNAME does exist on the filesystem but is not versioned, mv
  assumes that the file has been manually moved and only updates
  its internal inventory to reflect that change.
  The same is valid when moving many SOURCE files to a DESTINATION.
  
  Files cannot be moved between branches.

:Aliases:  move, rename
