:Description:
  This operation compresses the data within a bazaar repository. As
  bazaar supports automatic packing of repository, this operation is
  normally not required to be done manually.
  
  During the pack operation, bazaar takes a backup of existing repository
  data, i.e. pack files. This backup is eventually removed by bazaar
  automatically when it is safe to do so. To save disk space by removing
  the backed up pack files, the --clean-obsolete-packs option may be
  used.
  
  Warning: If you use --clean-obsolete-packs and your machine crashes
  during or immediately after repacking, you may be left with a state
  where the deletion has been written to disk but the new packs have not
  been. In this case the repository may be unusable.
