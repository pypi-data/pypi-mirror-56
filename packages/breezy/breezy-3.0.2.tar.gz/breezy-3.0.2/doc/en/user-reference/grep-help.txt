grep
====

:Purpose: Print lines matching PATTERN for specified files and revisions.
:Usage:   brz grep PATTERN [PATH...]

:Options:
  --color=WHEN          Show match in color. WHEN is never, always or auto.
  -p, --diff            Grep for pattern in changeset for each revision.
  -X GLOB, --exclude=GLOB
                        Skip files whose base name matches GLOB.
  -l, --files-with-matches
                        Print only the name of each input file in which
                        PATTERN is found.
  -L, --files-without-match
                        Print only the name of each input file in which
                        PATTERN is not found.
  -F, --fixed-string    Interpret PATTERN is a single fixed string (not
                        regex).
  --from-root           Search for pattern starting from the root of the
                        branch. (implies --recursive)
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  -i, --ignore-case     Ignore case distinctions while matching.
  -I GLOB, --include=GLOB
                        Search only files whose base name matches GLOB.
  --levels=N            Number of levels to display - 0 for all, 1 for
                        collapsed (1 is default).
  -n, --line-number     Show 1-based line number.
  --no-recursive        Don't recurse into subdirectories. (default is
                        --recursive)
  -Z, --null            Write an ASCII NUL (\0) separator between output lines
                        rather than a newline.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  -r ARG, --revision=ARG
                        See "help revisionspec" for details.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

:Description:
  This command searches the specified files and revisions for a given
  pattern.  The pattern is specified as a Python regular expressions[1].
  
  If the file name is not specified, the revisions starting with the
  current directory are searched recursively. If the revision number is
  not specified, the working copy is searched. To search the last committed
  revision, use the '-r -1' or '-r last:1' option.
  
  Unversioned files are not searched unless explicitly specified on the
  command line. Unversioned directores are not searched.
  
  When searching a pattern, the output is shown in the 'filepath:string'
  format. If a revision is explicitly searched, the output is shown as
  'filepath~N:string', where N is the revision number.
  
  --include and --exclude options can be used to search only (or exclude
  from search) files with base name matches the specified Unix style GLOB
  pattern.  The GLOB pattern an use *, ?, and [...] as wildcards, and \
  to quote wildcard or backslash character literally. Note that the glob
  pattern is not a regular expression.
