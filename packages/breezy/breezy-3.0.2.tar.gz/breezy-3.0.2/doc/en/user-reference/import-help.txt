:Description:
  This command will import a directory, tarball or zip file into a bzr
  tree, replacing any versioned files already present.  If a directory is
  specified, it is used as the target.  If the directory does not exist, or
  is not versioned, it is created.
  
  Tarballs may be gzip or bzip2 compressed.  This is autodetected.
  
  If the tarball or zip has a single root directory, that directory is
  stripped when extracting the tarball.  This is not done for directories.
