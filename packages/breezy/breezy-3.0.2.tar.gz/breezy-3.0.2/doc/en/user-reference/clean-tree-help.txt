clean-tree
==========

:Purpose: Remove unwanted files from working tree.
:Usage:   brz clean-tree

:Options:
  --detritus            Delete conflict files, merge and revert backups, and
                        failed selftest dirs.
  -d ARG, --directory=ARG
                        Branch to operate on, instead of working directory.
  --dry-run             Show files to delete instead of deleting them.
  --force               Do not prompt before deleting.
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  --ignored             Delete all ignored files.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  --unknown             Delete files unknown to brz (default).
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

:Description:
  By default, only unknown files, not ignored files, are deleted.  Versioned
  files are never deleted.
  
  Another class is 'detritus', which includes files emitted by brz during
  normal operations and selftests.  (The value of these files decreases with
  time.)
  
  If no options are specified, unknown files are deleted.  Otherwise, option
  flags are respected, and may be combined.
  
  To check what clean-tree will do, use --dry-run.
