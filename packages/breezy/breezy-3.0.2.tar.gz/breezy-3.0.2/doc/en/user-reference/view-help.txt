:Description:
  Views provide a mask over the tree so that users can focus on
  a subset of a tree when doing their work. After creating a view,
  commands that support a list of files - status, diff, commit, etc -
  effectively have that list of files implicitly given each time.
  An explicit list of files can still be given but those files
  must be within the current view.
  
  In most cases, a view has a short life-span: it is created to make
  a selected change and is deleted once that change is committed.
  At other times, you may wish to create one or more named views
  and switch between them.
  
  To disable the current view without deleting it, you can switch to
  the pseudo view called ``off``. This can be useful when you need
  to see the whole tree for an operation or two (e.g. merge) but
  want to switch back to your view after that.

:Examples:
  To define the current view::

    brz view file1 dir1 ...

  To list the current view::

    brz view

  To delete the current view::

    brz view --delete

  To disable the current view without deleting it::

    brz view --switch off

  To define a named view and switch to it::

    brz view --name view-name file1 dir1 ...

  To list a named view::

    brz view --name view-name

  To delete a named view::

    brz view --name view-name --delete

  To switch to a named view::

    brz view --switch view-name

  To list all views defined::

    brz view --all

  To delete all views::

    brz view --delete --all
