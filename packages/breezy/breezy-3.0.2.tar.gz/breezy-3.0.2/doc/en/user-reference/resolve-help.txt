:Description:
  Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
  are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those,
  it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something,
  before you can commit.
  
  Once you have fixed a problem, use "brz resolve" to automatically mark
  text conflicts as fixed, "brz resolve FILE" to mark a specific conflict as
  resolved, or "brz resolve --all" to mark all conflicts as resolved.
