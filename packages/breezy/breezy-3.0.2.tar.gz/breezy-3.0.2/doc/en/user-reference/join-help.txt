:Description:
  This command requires the target tree to be in a rich-root format.
  
  The TREE argument should be an independent tree, inside another tree, but
  not part of it.  (Such trees can be produced by "brz split", but also by
  running "brz branch" with the target inside a tree.)
  
  The result is a combined tree, with the subtree no longer an independent
  part.  This is marked as a merge of the subtree into the containing tree,
  and all history is preserved.
