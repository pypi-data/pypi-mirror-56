serve
=====

:Purpose: Run the brz server.
:Usage:   brz serve

:Options:
  --allow-writes        By default the server is a readonly server.  Supplying
                        --allow-writes enables write access to the contents of
                        the served directory and below.  Note that ``brz
                        serve`` does not perform authentication, so unless
                        some form of external authentication is arranged
                        supplying this option leads to global uncontrolled
                        write access to your file system.
  --client-timeout=ARG  Override the default idle client timeout (5min).
  -d ARG, --directory=ARG
                        Serve contents of this directory.
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  --inet                Serve on stdin/out for use from inetd or sshd.
  --listen=ARG          Listen for connections on nominated address.
  --port=ARG            Listen for connections on nominated port.  Passing 0
                        as the port number will result in a dynamically
                        allocated port.  The default port depends on the
                        protocol.
