init-repository
===============

:Purpose: Create a shared repository for branches to share storage space.
:Usage:   brz init-repository LOCATION

:Options:
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  --no-trees            Branches in the repository will default to not having
                        a working tree.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

  Repository format:
    --format=ARG        Specify a format for this repository. See "brz help
                        formats" for details.
    --2a, --default, --bzr
                        Format for the bzr 2.0 series.
    --git               GIT repository.
    --git-bare          Bare GIT repository (no working tree).

:Description:
  New branches created under the repository directory will store their
  revisions in the repository, not in the branch directory.  For branches
  with shared history, this reduces the amount of storage needed and
  speeds up the creation of new branches.
  
  If the --no-trees option is given then the branches in the repository
  will not have working trees by default.  They will still exist as
  directories on disk, but they will not have separate copies of the
  files at a certain revision.  This can be useful for repositories that
  store branches which are interacted with through checkouts or remote
  branches, such as on a server.

:Examples:
    Create a shared repository holding just branches::

        brz init-repo --no-trees repo
        brz init repo/trunk

    Make a lightweight checkout elsewhere::

        brz checkout --lightweight repo/trunk trunk-checkout
        cd trunk-checkout
        (add files here)
