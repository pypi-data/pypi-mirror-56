split
=====

:Purpose: Split a subdirectory of a tree into a separate tree.
:Usage:   brz split TREE

:Options:
  -h, --help     Show help message.
  -q, --quiet    Only display errors and warnings.
  --usage        Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose  Display more information.

:Description:
  This command will produce a target tree in a format that supports
  rich roots, like 'rich-root' or 'rich-root-pack'.  These formats cannot be
  converted into earlier formats like 'dirstate-tags'.
  
  The TREE argument should be a subdirectory of a working tree.  That
  subdirectory will be converted into an independent tree, with its own
  branch.  Commits in the top-level tree will not apply to the new subtree.
