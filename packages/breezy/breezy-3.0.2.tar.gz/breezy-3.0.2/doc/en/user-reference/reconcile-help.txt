=========

:Purpose: Reconcile brz metadata in a branch.
:Usage:   brz reconcile [BRANCH]

:Options:
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.

:Description:
  This can correct data mismatches that may have been caused by
  previous ghost operations or brz upgrades. You should only
  need to run this command if 'brz check' or a brz developer
  advises you to run it.
  
  If a second branch is provided, cross-branch reconciliation is
  also attempted, which will check that data like the tree root
  id which was not present in very early brz versions is represented
  correctly in both branches.
  
  At the same time it is run it may recompress data resulting in
  a potential saving in disk space or performance gain.
  
  The branch *MUST* be on a listable system such as local disk or sftp.
