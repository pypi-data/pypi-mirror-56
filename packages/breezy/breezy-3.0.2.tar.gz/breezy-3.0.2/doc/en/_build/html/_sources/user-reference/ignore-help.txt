:Description:
  See ``brz help patterns`` for details on the syntax of patterns.
  
  If a .bzrignore file does not exist, the ignore command
  will create one and add the specified files or patterns to the newly
  created file. The ignore command will also automatically add the
  .bzrignore file to be versioned. Creating a .bzrignore file without
  the use of the ignore command will require an explicit add command.
  
  To remove patterns from the ignore list, edit the .bzrignore file.
  After adding, editing or deleting that file either indirectly by
  using this command or directly by using an editor, be sure to commit
  it.
  
  Breezy also supports a global ignore file ~/.config/breezy/ignore. On
  Windows the global ignore file can be found in the application data
  directory as
  C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Breezy\3.0\ignore.
  Global ignores are not touched by this command. The global ignore file
  can be edited directly using an editor.
  
  Patterns prefixed with '!' are exceptions to ignore patterns and take
  precedence over regular ignores.  Such exceptions are used to specify
  files that should be versioned which would otherwise be ignored.
  
  Patterns prefixed with '!!' act as regular ignore patterns, but have
  precedence over the '!' exception patterns.
  
  * Ignore patterns containing shell wildcards must be quoted from
    the shell on Unix.
  
  * Ignore patterns starting with "#" act as comments in the ignore file.
    To ignore patterns that begin with that character, use the "RE:" prefix.

:Examples:
    Ignore the top level Makefile::

        brz ignore ./Makefile

    Ignore .class files in all directories...::

        brz ignore "*.class"

    ...but do not ignore "special.class"::

        brz ignore "!special.class"

    Ignore files whose name begins with the "#" character::

        brz ignore "RE:^#"

    Ignore .o files under the lib directory::

        brz ignore "lib/**/*.o"

    Ignore .o files under the lib directory::

        brz ignore "RE:lib/.*\.o"

    Ignore everything but the "debian" toplevel directory::

        brz ignore "RE:(?!debian/).*"

    Ignore everything except the "local" toplevel directory,
    but always ignore autosave files ending in ~, even under local/::

        brz ignore "*"
        brz ignore "!./local"
        brz ignore "!!*~"
