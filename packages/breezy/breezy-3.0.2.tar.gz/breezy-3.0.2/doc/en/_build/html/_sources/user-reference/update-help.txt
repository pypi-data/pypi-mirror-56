:Description:
  This will perform a merge of the destination revision (the tip of the
  branch, or the specified revision) into the working tree, and then make
  that revision the basis revision for the working tree.
  
  You can use this to visit an older revision, or to update a working tree
  that is out of date from its branch.
  
  If there are any uncommitted changes in the tree, they will be carried
  across and remain as uncommitted changes after the update.  To discard
  these changes, use 'brz revert'.  The uncommitted changes may conflict
  with the changes brought in by the change in basis revision.
  
  If the tree's branch is bound to a master branch, brz will also update
  the branch from the master.
  
  You cannot update just a single file or directory, because each Breezy
  working tree has just a single basis revision.  If you want to restore a
  file that has been removed locally, use 'brz revert' instead of 'brz
  update'.  If you want to restore a file to its state in a previous
  revision, use 'brz revert' with a '-r' option, or use 'brz cat' to write
  out the old content of that file to a new location.
  
  The 'dir' argument, if given, must be the location of the root of a
  working tree to update.  By default, the working tree that contains the
  current working directory is used.
