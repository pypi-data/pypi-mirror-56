<h1>Checkouts<a class="headerlink" href="#checkouts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Checkouts are source trees that are connected to a branch, so that when
you commit in the source tree, the commit goes into that branch.  They
allow you to use a simpler, more centralized workflow, ignoring some of
Breezy’s decentralized features until you want them. Using checkouts
with shared repositories is very similar to working with SVN or CVS, but
doesn’t have the same restrictions.  And using checkouts still allows
others working on the project to use whatever workflow they like.</p>
<p>A checkout is created with the brz checkout command (see “help checkout”).
You pass it a reference to another branch, and it will create a local copy
for you that still contains a reference to the branch you created the
checkout from (the master branch). Then if you make any commits they will be
made on the other branch first. This creates an instant mirror of your work, or
facilitates lockstep development, where each developer is working together,
continuously integrating the changes of others.</p>
<p>However the checkout is still a first class branch in Breezy terms, so that
you have the full history locally.  As you have a first class branch you can
also commit locally if you want, for instance due to the temporary loss af a
network connection. Use the –local option to commit to do this. All the local
commits will then be made on the master branch the next time you do a non-local
commit.</p>
<p>If you are using a checkout from a shared branch you will periodically want to
pull in all the changes made by others. This is done using the “update”
command. The changes need to be applied before any non-local commit, but
Breezy will tell you if there are any changes and suggest that you use this
command when needed.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create a “lightweight” checkout by passing the
–lightweight flag to checkout. A lightweight checkout is even closer to an
SVN checkout in that it is not a first class branch, it mainly consists of the
working tree. This means that any history operations must query the master
branch, which could be slow if a network connection is involved. Also, as you
don’t have a local branch, then you cannot commit locally.</p>
<p>Lightweight checkouts work best when you have fast reliable access to the
master branch. This means that if the master branch is on the same disk or LAN
a lightweight checkout will be faster than a heavyweight one for any commands
that modify the revision history (as only one copy of the branch needs to
be updated). Heavyweight checkouts will generally be faster for any command
that uses the history but does not change it, but if the master branch is on
the same disk then there won’t be a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>Another possible use for a checkout is to use it with a treeless repository
containing your branches, where you maintain only one working tree by
switching the master branch that the checkout points to when you want to
work on a different branch.</p>
<p>Obviously to commit on a checkout you need to be able to write to the master
branch. This means that the master branch must be accessible over a writeable
protocol , such as sftp://, and that you have write permissions at the other
end. Checkouts also work on the local file system, so that all that matters is
file permissions.</p>
<p>You can change the master of a checkout by using the “switch” command (see
“help switch”).  This will change the location that the commits are sent to.
The “bind” command can also be used to turn a normal branch into a heavy
checkout. If you would like to convert your heavy checkout into a normal
branch so that every commit is local, you can use the “unbind” command. To see
whether or not a branch is bound or not you can use the “info” command. If the
branch is bound it will tell you the location of the bound branch.</p>
