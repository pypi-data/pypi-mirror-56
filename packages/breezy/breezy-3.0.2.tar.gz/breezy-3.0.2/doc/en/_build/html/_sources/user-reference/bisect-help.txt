:Description:
  Bisecting, in a nutshell, is a way to find the commit at which
  some testable change was made, such as the introduction of a bug
  or feature.  By identifying a version which did not have the
  interesting change and a later version which did, a developer
  can test for the presence of the change at various points in
  the history, eventually ending up at the precise commit when
  the change was first introduced.
  
  This command uses subcommands to implement the search, each
  of which changes the state of the bisection.  The
  subcommands are:
  
  brz bisect start
      Start a bisect, possibly clearing out a previous bisect.
  
  brz bisect yes [-r rev]
      The specified revision (or the current revision, if not given)
      has the characteristic we're looking for,
  
  brz bisect no [-r rev]
      The specified revision (or the current revision, if not given)
      does not have the characteristic we're looking for,
  
  brz bisect move -r rev
      Switch to a different revision manually.  Use if the bisect
      algorithm chooses a revision that is not suitable.  Try to
      move as little as possible.
  
  brz bisect reset
      Clear out a bisection in progress.
  
  brz bisect log [-o file]
      Output a log of the current bisection to standard output, or
      to the specified file.
  
  brz bisect replay <logfile>
      Replay a previously-saved bisect log, forgetting any bisection
      that might be in progress.
  
  brz bisect run <script>
      Bisect automatically using <script> to determine 'yes' or 'no'.
      <script> should exit with:
         0 for yes
         125 for unknown (like build failed so we could not test)
         anything else for no
