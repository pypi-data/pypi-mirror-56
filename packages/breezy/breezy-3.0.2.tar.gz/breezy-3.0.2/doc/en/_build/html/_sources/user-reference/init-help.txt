:Purpose: Make a directory into a versioned branch.
:Usage:   brz init [LOCATION]

                        not already exist.

    --2a, --default, --bzr
                        Format for the bzr 2.0 series.
    --git               GIT repository.
    --git-bare          Bare GIT repository (no working tree).

:Description:
  Use this to create an empty branch, or before importing an
  existing project.
  
  If there is a repository in a parent directory of the location, then
  the history of the branch will be stored in the repository.  Otherwise
  init creates a standalone branch which carries its own history
  in the .bzr directory.
  
  If there is already a branch at the location but it has no working tree,
  the tree can be populated with 'brz checkout'.
  
  Recipe for importing a tree of files::
  
      cd ~/project
      brz init
      brz add .
      brz status
      brz commit -m "imported project"
