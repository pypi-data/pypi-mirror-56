URL Identifiers
===============


Supported URL prefixes::

  bzr://              Fast access using the Bazaar smart server.
  bzr+ssh://          Fast access using the Bazaar smart server over SSH.
  file://             Access using the standard filesystem (default)
  http://             Read-only access of branches exported on the web.
  https://            Read-only access of branches exported on the web using SSL.
  sftp://             Access using SFTP (most SSH servers provide SFTP).

Supported modifiers::

  gio+                Access using any GIO supported protocols.

Breezy supports all of the standard parts within the URL::

  <protocol>://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/[path]

allowing URLs such as::

  http://brzuser:BadPass@brz.example.com:8080/brz/trunk

For brz+ssh:// and sftp:// URLs, Breezy also supports paths that begin
with '~' as meaning that the rest of the path should be interpreted
relative to the remote user's home directory.  For example if the user
``remote`` has a  home directory of ``/home/remote`` on the server
shell.example.com, then::

  brz+ssh://remote@shell.example.com/~/myproject/trunk

would refer to ``/home/remote/myproject/trunk``.

Many commands that accept URLs also accept location aliases too.
See :doc:`location-alias-help` and :doc:`url-special-chars-help`.
