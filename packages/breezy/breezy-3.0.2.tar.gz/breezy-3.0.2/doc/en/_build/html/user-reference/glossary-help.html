<dt id="term-ancestor">ancestor</dt><dd><p>An ancestor is one of any of the revisions that this revision is based on.

</dd>
<dt id="term-ancestral-parent">ancestral parent</dt><dd><p>Any branch that has been merged by another branch and then committed

</dd>
<dt id="term-branch">branch</dt><dd><p>a line of development. In the simplest of terms, a branch is the record of
all the commits that have been done. Every <a class="reference internal" href="#term-working-tree"><span class="xref std std-term">working tree</span></a> has a
branch, but it may be in a different location. The actual revisions
produced by the commits are stored in a repository, which is sometimes
shared with other
branches.</p>
<p>A frequent activity done by users within the working tree of a branch is to
merge another branch. In this way users can share changes between two
branches – even if the branch is run by someone else.</p>
<p>Bazaar’s default behavior is to put the repository, branch, and working
tree all in the same place. This combination is called a standalone tree.
If there is no tree, it is called a <span class="xref std std-term">standalone branch</span>. If the
repository is shared with other branches, it is called a repository branch.
A working tree in a different location from its branch is called a
checkout.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-branch-bound">branch, bound</dt><dd><p>A bound branch is a branch that does not commit a new revision until after
the revision has been applied to another branch and first.</p>
<p>A bound branch is a part of a <span class="xref std std-term">heavyweight checkout</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-cherry-pick">cherry-pick</dt><dd><p>A cherrypick is an operation in which the delta between two revisions is
applied to a working tree. The process is roughly similiar to generating a
diff between two revisions and applying it to a working tree.</p>
<p>A cherrypick is a merge in which a range of revisions are selected and
merged into a working tree . Performing a limited merge is different than a
normal merge because normal merges imply all missing revisions should be
merged. One of the results of cherrypicking is the creation of intransitive
ancestors, which are revisons that are missing one or more of their
ancestors.</p>
<p>A cherrypick in Bazaar is a bit more advanced than the cherrypick with some
other revision control systems, in that a three way merge is performed
rather than a strict delta between revisions.</p>
<p>The downside to cherrypicking is that Bazaar does not track cherrypicked
revisions, although this feature is firmly on the wish list.</p>
<p>A common use-case for cherrypicking is the back-porting of fixes from an
ongoing branch of development to stable release branches.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-checkout">checkout</dt><dd><p>A checkout is essentially a working tree that is linked to a branch at a
different location.</p>
<p>Checkouts also have local branches, which function as a local cache. This
means that checkouts can be used effectively even with branches that are
accessed through the Internet. Normal checkouts are sometimes called
heavyweight checkouts to distinguish them from lightweight checkouts.</p>
<p>A lightweight checkout is a related construct that lacks the local branch.
Lightweight checkouts are smaller, but require fast access to the branch,
such as on a LAN or local hard disk.</p>
<p>Checkouts provide a location for people to hack on code and commit. Once a
user commits, the associated branch is updated with a new revision that
represents the changes for the commit.</p>

<dt id="term-dag">dag</dt><dd><p>Directed Acyclic Graph. The graph of revisions where each revision is
connected to its parent revisions.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-delta">delta</dt><dd><p>A delta is defined as the changes between two revisions. Any RCS that has
revisions typically builds a delta in order to perform a diff</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-merge">merge</dt><dd><p>Merging is the process of applying all the changes that were introduced in
one branch into another branch, without applying any changes that are
already common to both branches. Sometimes a user will not want all of the
changes. For these cases, a user may instead prefer a cherrypick, which
gives the user the option to apply only those revisions that are wanted.</p>
<p>As well as altering the working tree, bzr’s merge command will also get all
of the revisions that a branch has, and add metadata indicating that a
merge has been performed.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-merge-criss-cross">merge, criss-cross</dt><dd><p>A failed type of merge caused by two branches merging each other at the
same time.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-nuclear-launch-codes">nuclear launch codes</dt><dd><p>Nuclear launch codes are an example of data that has been committed to a
branch that must be removed at all costs. Imagine if one had access to the
launch codes for a nuclear warhead, accidentally committed them to a branch
and then pushed the branch to a public place.</p>
<p>In real world situations most people do not have access to nuclear
launchcodes. Users may have data such as passwords, proprietary code and
other sensitive data. Accidental release of this type of data is
potentially damaging to the branch owner – perhaps damaging enough that
the developer may hope for a nuclear disaster!</p>
<p>A user dealing with a nuclear launch code problem needs specific data in
the branch to be exised at all costs and in a rapid manner.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-repository">repository</dt><dd><p>A library of revisions for branches.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-revision">revision</dt><dd><p>A revision is one state of the code.</p>
<p>bzr is snapshot based, meaning that conceptually it stores the whole state
of the tree at each revision. This is in contrast to changeset based, where
a revision refers to just the changes that were made in that revision. I
said “conceptually”, as internally bzr uses delta compression to reduce the
amount of data that it stores, and so may only record the changes in a
revision. However you must always think of a revision as referring to a
whole snapshot.</p>
<p>A revision also contains some metadata. In particular it stores the
committer, and the timestamp when the commit was made, the log message that
was given, and the nick of the branch on which the commit was made. It also
stores pointers to the parent revisions, i.e. the revision preceeding it,
and the tip revisions of any branches that were merged. Lastly it stores a
number of revision properties, these is extra information that can be
stored with the revision and is immutable, some uses of them are to store
the author of the patch if it wasn’t the committer (when given using the
–author option of bzr commit), or to store information about the bugs
fixed in that revision if using the bug-tracker integration.</p>
<p>A revision also has a name, referred to as a revision id. This is a
globally unique identifier for the revision so that it can be referred to
without ambiguity. This means that two revisions are identical, if, and
only if, they have the same revision id.</p>
<p>A revision may also be referred to using a revision number, however this is
not a globally unique identifier, meaning that revision 14 of your branch
may not be the same as revision 14 of my branch, even if they are the same
project. The only way to know if they are the same revision is to compare
the revision ids. This means that when talking about a revision you must
either use it’s revision id, or also explain which branch you are referring
to when you specify a revision number.</p>
<p>Tags point at a revision, and so they may also be used to when referring to
a commit, but again, two different branches may have the same tag name
pointing to two different revisions, and so you should also give the branch
to which you are referring when stating a tag name.</p>

<dt id="term-revision-ancestor">revision, ancestor</dt><dd><p>An ancestor is one of any of the revisions that this revision is based on.
The immediately prior revision has a special name, the parent revision.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-revision-ghost">revision, ghost</dt><dd><p>A ghost <a class="reference internal" href="#term-revision"><span class="xref std std-term">revision</span></a>, also called a ghost, is a revision that a
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-branch"><span class="xref std std-term">branch</span></a> knows about but does not have.</p>
<p>Ghost revisions can occur in unusual situations such as the migration of
branches from foreign revision control systems into Bazaar format.</p>
<p>Ghost revisions can be scary the first time that a user bumps into them.
Thankfully though, revision ghosts are just like real ghosts (such as they
are) in that their discorporeal existence typically causes little, if any,
harm.</p>

<dt id="term-revision-parent">revision, parent</dt><dd><p>The revision that comes immediately prior to this revision.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-shared-repository">shared repository</dt><dd><p>A shared repository is similar to the traditional concept of a repository
in other VCSs like CVS and Subversion. For example, in Subversion you have
a remote repository, which is where all of the history is stored, and
locally you don’t have any history information, only a checkout of the
working tree files. Note that “Shared” in this context means shared between
branches. It <em>may</em> be shared between people, but standalone branches
can also be shared between people.</p>
<p>In <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">Breezy_</span></a> terms, a “Shared Repository” is a location where multiple
branches can <strong>share</strong> their revision history information. In order to
support decentralized workflows, it is possible for every branch to
store its own revision history information. But this is often
inefficient, since related branches share history, and they might as
well share the storage as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-tag">tag</dt><dd><p>A tag is a nickname for a particular <a class="reference internal" href="#term-revision"><span class="xref std std-term">revision</span></a>. The typical use is to mark a
release of the software so you can easily refer to it later.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-working-tree">working tree</dt><dd><p>A working tree is a directory with project files that a user can edit.</p>
<p>Unlike a normal directory, a working tree is associated with a
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-branch"><span class="xref std std-term">branch</span></a>. The working tree is the space in which commands such as
commit and revert operate.</p>
