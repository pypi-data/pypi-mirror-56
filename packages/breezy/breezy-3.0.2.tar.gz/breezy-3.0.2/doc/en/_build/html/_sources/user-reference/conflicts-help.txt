=========

:Purpose: List files with conflicts.
:Usage:   brz conflicts

                        Branch to operate on, instead of working directory.
  -h, --help            Show help message.

  --text                List paths of files with text conflicts.

  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

:Description:
  Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
  are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those,
  it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something,
  before you can commit.
  
  Conflicts normally are listed as short, human-readable messages.  If --text
  is supplied, the pathnames of files with text conflicts are listed,
  instead.  (This is useful for editing all files with text conflicts.)
  
  Use brz resolve when you have fixed a problem.
