===========

:Purpose: Reconfigure the type of a brz directory.
:Usage:   brz reconfigure [LOCATION]

:Options:
  --bind-to=ARG         Branch to bind checkout to.

                        lost.
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  --stacked-on=ARG      Reconfigure a branch to be stacked on another branch.
  --unstacked           Reconfigure a branch to be unstacked.  This may
                        require copying substantial data into it.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

  Trees in Repository:
    --with-no-trees     Reconfigure repository to not create working trees on
                        branches by default.
    --with-trees        Reconfigure repository to create working trees on
                        branches by default.

  Repository type:
    --standalone        Reconfigure to be a standalone branch (i.e. stop using
                        shared repository).
    --use-shared        Reconfigure to use a shared repository.

  Tree type:
    --branch            Reconfigure to be an unbound branch with no working
                        tree.
    --checkout          Reconfigure to be a bound branch with a working tree.
    --lightweight-checkout
                        Reconfigure to be a lightweight checkout (with no
                        local history).
    --tree              Reconfigure to be an unbound branch with a working
                        tree.

:Description:
  A target configuration must be specified.
  
  For checkouts, the bind-to location will be auto-detected if not specified.
  The order of preference is
  1. For a lightweight checkout, the current bound location.
  2. For branches that used to be checkouts, the previously-bound location.
  3. The push location.
  4. The parent location.
  If none of these is available, --bind-to must be specified.
