:Description:
  --verbose will print out what is being removed.
  --dry-run will go through all the motions, but not actually
  remove anything.
  
  If --revision is specified, uncommit revisions to leave the branch at the
  specified revision.  For example, "brz uncommit -r 15" will leave the
  branch at revision 15.
  
  Uncommit leaves the working tree ready for a new commit.  The only change
  it may make is to restore any pending merges that were present before
  the commit.
