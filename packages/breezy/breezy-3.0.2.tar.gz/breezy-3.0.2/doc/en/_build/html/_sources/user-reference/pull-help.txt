pull
====

:Purpose: Turn this branch into a mirror of another branch.
:Usage:   brz pull [LOCATION]

:Options:
  -d ARG, --directory=ARG
                        Branch to pull into, rather than the one containing
                        the working directory.
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  --local               Perform a local pull in a bound branch.  Local pulls
                        are not applied to the master branch.
  --overwrite           Ignore differences between branches and overwrite
                        unconditionally.
  --overwrite-tags      Overwrite tags only.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  --remember            Remember the specified location as a default.
  -r ARG, --revision=ARG
                        See "help revisionspec" for details.
  --show-base           Show base revision text in conflicts.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose         Show logs of pulled revisions.

:Description:
  By default, this command only works on branches that have not diverged.
  Branches are considered diverged if the destination branch's most recent
  commit is one that has not been merged (directly or indirectly) into the
  parent.
  
  If branches have diverged, you can use 'brz merge' to integrate the changes
  from one into the other.  Once one branch has merged, the other should
  be able to pull it again.
  
  If you want to replace your local changes and just want your branch to
  match the remote one, use pull --overwrite. This will work even if the two
  branches have diverged.
  
  If there is no default location set, the first pull will set it (use
  --no-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the
  location to use the default.  To change the default, use --remember. The
  value will only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.
  
  The --verbose option will display the revisions pulled using the log_format
  configuration option. You can use a different format by overriding it with
  -Olog_format=<other_format>.
  
  Note: The location can be specified either in the form of a branch,
  or in the form of a path to a file containing a merge directive generated
  with brz send.
