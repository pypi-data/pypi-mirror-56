Location aliases
================

Bazaar defines several aliases for locations associated with a branch.  These
can be used with most commands that expect a location, such as `brz push`.

The aliases are::

  :bound     The branch this branch is bound to, for bound branches.
  :parent    The parent of this branch.
  :public    The public location of this branch.
  :push      The saved location used for `brz push` with no arguments.
  :submit    The submit branch for this branch.
  :this      This branch.

For example, to push to the parent location::

    brz push :parent
