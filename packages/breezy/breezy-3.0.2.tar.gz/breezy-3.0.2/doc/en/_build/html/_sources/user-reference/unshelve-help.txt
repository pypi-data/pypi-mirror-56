unshelve
========

:Purpose: Restore shelved changes.
:Usage:   brz unshelve [SHELF_ID]

:Options:
  -d ARG, --directory=ARG
                        Branch to operate on, instead of working directory.
  -h, --help            Show help message.
  -q, --quiet           Only display errors and warnings.
  --usage               Show usage message and options.
  -v, --verbose         Display more information.

  action:
    --apply             Apply changes and remove from the shelf.
    --delete-only       Delete changes without applying them.
    --dry-run           Show changes, but do not apply or remove them.
    --keep              Apply changes but don't delete them.
    --preview           Instead of unshelving the changes, show the diff that
                        would result from unshelving.

:Description:
  By default, the most recently shelved changes are restored. However if you
  specify a shelf by id those changes will be restored instead.  This works
  best when the changes don't depend on each other.
