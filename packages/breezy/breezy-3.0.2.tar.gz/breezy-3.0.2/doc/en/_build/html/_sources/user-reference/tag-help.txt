:Description:
  Tags give human-meaningful names to revisions.  Commands that take a -r
  (--revision) option can be given -rtag:X, where X is any previously
  created tag.
  
  Tags are stored in the branch.  Tags are copied from one branch to another
  along when you branch, push, pull or merge.
  
  It is an error to give a tag name that already exists unless you pass
  --force, in which case the tag is moved to point to the new revision.
  
  To rename a tag (change the name but keep it on the same revsion), run ``brz
  tag new-name -r tag:old-name`` and then ``brz tag --delete oldname``.
  
  If no tag name is specified it will be determined through the
  'automatic_tag_name' hook. This can e.g. be used to automatically tag
  upstream releases by reading configure.ac. See ``brz help hooks`` for
  details.
