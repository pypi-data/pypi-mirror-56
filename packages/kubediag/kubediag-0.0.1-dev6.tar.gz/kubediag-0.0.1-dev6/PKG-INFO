Description: # kubediag - Kubernetes Diagnostic Tool
        
        Kubernetes Diagnostic Tool built by AWS Premium Support
        
        
        ## Goals
        
        As AWS Premium Support Engineers, we spend a great deal of time helping troubleshoot and understand our customer's most
        complex Kubernetes issues. To make the process of collecting information as seemless as possible for our customers we
        created the kubediag utility tool.
        
        This tool can perform rudimentary configuration checks on an existing Kubernetes cluster and collect any necessary logs
        and configurations in a secure way to aid in diagnosing Kubernetes issues.
        
        The tool can also be used to visualize the information that's collected to help give insight into common issues we've
        seen while helping our customers find success with Kubernetes.
        
        
        ## Installation & Usage
        
        This tool is published as a PyPI package which can be installed via Pip as follows:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -U kubediag
        $ kubediag --version
        ```
        
        ### Docker
        
        If you have Docker installed, you can run this tool via the docker image.
        
        ```bash
        $ docker run -it --rm -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube fortejas/kubediag version
        ```
