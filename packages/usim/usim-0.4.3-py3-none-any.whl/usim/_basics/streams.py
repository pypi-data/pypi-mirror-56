Synchronizing streams that allow consumers to wait for messages from producers

Streams synchronize **adding** and **retrieving** messages
across multiple producers and consumers.
This allows consumers to wait for messages,
and producers to delay messages as required.

Consumers can retrieve individual messages
or iterate over all messages:

.. code:: python

    value = await stream  # consume a single message from the stream

    async for value in stream:  # consume messages until the stream is closed
        ...

Similarly, producers can send individual or several messages at once:

.. code:: python

    await stream.put(value)
    await stream.send(values)

Note that channels exist *exclusively* for message passing,
and do not serve as :py:class:`Notification`\ s.
A channel cannot be used in an ``async with until(...):`` statement.
