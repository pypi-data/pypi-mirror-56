class Loop:
    r"""
    Interrupt based event loop with side-channel control using simulated time

    :param coroutines: the initial payloads to run
    :param start: the initial time of the simulation
    :ivar time: the current simulation time
    :ivar turn: the number of coroutines run in the current time step so far
    :ivar activity: the coroutine currently executing

    The event loop runs a number of coroutines concurrently.
    By interacting with the event loop to exchange commands,
    coroutines are synchronized.
    Commands are either ``await``\ able, issued in an ``async def`` coroutine,
    or side-channel via ``__LOOP_STATE__.LOOP``,
    issued by either coroutines or subroutines.

    The event loop understands only a single ``await``\ able command,
    :py:class:`Hibernate`, which immediately suspends the currently active coroutine.
    This does *not* schedule the coroutine for resumption.
    This must be done separately.

    .. code:: python

        async def sleep():
            print('start')
            await Hibernate()  # suspend execution indefinitely
            print('awoken')    # only run if the coroutine is re-scheduled somehow

    The :py:class:`Loop` instance running in the current thread
    is available as ``__LOOP_STATE__.LOOP``.
    This reference may be used by coroutines to send non-suspending commands
    to the loop.

    The event loop understands only a single side-channel command,
    :py:meth:`~.Loop.schedule`, which schedules the execution of a coroutine
    at a simulated time point.
    A coroutine is executed either by sending :py:const:`None`
    or throwing an :py:class:`~.Interrupt`.

    .. code:: python

        async def sleep(duration: float):
            print('start')
            interrupt = Interrupt('sleep', duration)
            # awake current activity from sleep via a scheduled interrupt
            __LOOP_STATE__.LOOP.schedule(__LOOP_STATE__.LOOP.activity, delay=duration)
            try:
                await Hibernate()

                # revoke the interrupt on exit in case *another* interrupt occured
                interrupt.revoke()

    Sending :py:const:`None` must be used for the first schedule,
    while :py:class:`~.Interrupt` should be used for subsequent ones.
    Note that only :py:class:`~.Interrupt` can be revoked.
    The :py:class:`Loop` can also handle subclasses of :py:class:`~.Interrupt`,
    allowing to efficiently send interrupts with payloads.
