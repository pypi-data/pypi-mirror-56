class Scope:
    r"""
    Concurrency scope that allows branching off and waiting for multiple activities

    A new :py:class:`~.Scope` must be opened in an ``async with`` block.
    During its block, a :py:class:`~.Scope` may :py:meth:`~.Scope.do`
    several activities concurrently.
    The :py:class:`~.Scope` owns and supervises all branched off activities.

    .. code:: python3

        async def show_clock(interval=1):
            "An infinite loop showing the current time"
            async for now in every(interval=interval):
                print(now)

        async with Scope() as scope:
            scope.do(time + 20)  # scope can launch multiple activities at once...
            scope.do(time + 20)
            scope.do(time + 20)
            scope.do(
                show_clock(),
                volatile=True
            )  #  ...and mark some as expendable on exit
            # block is exited once the three delays finished concurrently
        # block is done after a total delay of 20

    Both the block of scope and all its activities form one unit of control.
    A :py:class:`~.Scope` will only exit once its block and all non-``volatile``
    activities are done.
    If either encounters an unhandled exception, all are aborted;
    exceptions from child tasks are collapsed into a single :py:exc:`~.Concurrent`
    exception which is raised by the :py:class:`~.Scope`.
    Only the fatal exception types :py:exc:`SystemExit`, :py:exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`,
    and :py:exc:`AssertionError` are not collapsed, but propagated directly.

    During its lifetime, a :py:class:`~.Scope` can be passed around freely.
    Most importantly, it can be passed to child activities.
    This allows to :py:meth:`~.Scope.do` things in a parent scope, and to ``await``
    the end of the scope.

        All non-``volatile`` activities are ``await``\ ed at the end of the scope.

        all child exceptions are collected and re-raised as part of a single
        :py:exc:`~.Concurrent` exception in this case.

        If an activity needs to shut down gracefully with its scope,
        it can `await` the scope.

        All ``volatile`` activities are aborted at the end of the scope,
        after all non-``volatile`` activities have finished.
        Aborting ``volatile`` activities is not graceful:
        :py:class:`GeneratorExit` is raised in the activity,
        which must exit without ``await``\ ing or ``yield``\ ing anything.

        The scope assumes exclusive ownership of the ``payload``:
        no activity should modify the ``payload`` directly.
        The scope takes the responsibility to ``await`` and
        cleanup the payload as needed.

        It is not possible to :py:meth:`~.do` activities after the scope has ended.
        A :py:exc:`~.ScopeClosed` exception is raised in this case.
