"""
For simulation time there is no inherent time unit, such as seconds,
hours, or years, implied.
A simulation should use a consistent time unit, however.

The default time type is :py:class:`float`, which in principle may exhibit
imprecision for fractions.
Using the standard SI unit of seconds on a 64bit machine,
time can represent more than 285 million years of time accurately.

:note: When using a time of :py:class:`float` and reaching ``Time().now == math.inf``,
       it is still not possible to reach :py:class:`Eternity`.
       This may change in the future.
