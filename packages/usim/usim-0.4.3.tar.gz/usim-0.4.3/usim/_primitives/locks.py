class Lock:
    """
    Synchronization primitive that may be acquired by only one Activity at a time

    Locks enforce mutually exclusive access for Activities,
    by allowing only one owner at any time.
    Activities can acquire ownership of a :py:class:`~.Lock` only via an
    ``async with`` context, and automatically release when exiting the block:

    .. code:: python

        async with lock:
            ...

    Ownership of a lock is inherently tied to a specific :term:`activity`;
    it is not possible to acquire and release a :py:class:`~.Lock`
    across several activities.
    Every lock is re-entrant for its owning :term:`activity`:
    an Activity can acquire the same lock multiple times.
    This allows using Locks safely in recursive calls.

        Entering a :py:class:`~.Lock` in its context manager does not allow
        backing off when the :py:class:`~.Lock` cannot be acquired.
        Availability of a :py:class:`~.Lock` should be checked if it shall
        only be acquired when available.
