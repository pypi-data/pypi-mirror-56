Description: # Flask-Events
        Event organizer extension for Flask.
        
        ## Usage
        Initialize extension by providing Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy instances.
        ```python
        from flask import Flask
        from flask_eventplanner import EventPlanner
        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
        
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        db = SQLAlchemy(app)
        events = Events(app, db)
        
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run()
        ```
        The Flask-Events uses 7 SQLAlchemy models:
        - Venue: Facilities that hold events.
        - Room: Smaller units of venues that hold programs.
        - Event: Event model.
        - Program: Scheduled programs of event.
        - Organizer: Secondary table for users with organizing rights to event.
        - Invitation: Secondary table for users invited to event.
        - RSVP: Secondary table for users who submitted an RSVP to event.
        
        These models can be extended using declarative mixin classes `VenueMixin`, `RoomMixin`, etc.
