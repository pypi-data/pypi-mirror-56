# Datadog Take Home Project

### Requirements:
#### Overview
- Create a console program to monitor performance and availability of websites
- Websites and check intervals are user defined
- Users can keep the console app running and monitor the websites
#### Stats
- Check the different websites with their corresponding check intervals
  - Compute a few interesting metrics: availability, max/avg response times, response codes count and more...
  - Over different timeframes: 2 minutes and 10 minutes
- Every 10s, display the stats for the past 10 minutes for each website
- Every minute, displays the stats for the past hour for each website
#### Alerting
- When a website availability is below 80% for the past 2 minutes, add a message saying that "Website {website} is down. availability={availability}, time={time}"
- When availability resumes for the past 2 minutes, add another message detailing when the alert recovered
- Make sure all messages showing when alerting thresholds are crossed remain visible on the page for historical reasons
#### Tests & question
- Write a test for the alerting logic
- Explain how you'd improve on this application design
