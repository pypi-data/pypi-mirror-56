Description: # Jargon Distance
        
        Jason Portenoy 2018
        
        Implement the jargon distance measure from <a href="https://doi.org/10.15195/v1.a15" target="_blank">Vilhena et al. “Finding Cultural Holes: How Structure and Culture Diverge in Networks of Scholarly Communication.” (2014)</a>
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install from PyPI:
        
        `pip install jargon-distance`
        
        ### Usage
        
        Initialize a `JargonDistance` instance with a `term_counts` dict and (optionally) a `group_map` dict.
        `term_counts` is a mapping of document -> term counter (Counter object).
        
        ```
        from jargon_distance import JargonDistance
        j = JargonDistance(term_counts)
        ```
        
        Then, calculate the jargon distances:
        
        ```
        j.calculate_jargon_distance()
        j.write_to_file('jargon_distance.csv')
        ```
        
        The `jargon_distance.analysis` module can be used to visualize the jargon distance calculations. For example, below is a dendrogram showing the jargon distances between the text (unigrams) of different works of literature (from the [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) notebook).

        See [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) for a more detailed example.
