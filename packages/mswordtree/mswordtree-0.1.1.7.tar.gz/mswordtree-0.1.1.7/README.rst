mswordtree
----------

Parse your whole word document in a hierarchical tree structure. The
document content will be listed down as Heading and its children as
subheading/paragraph/table etc.

Install the library using following comand

::

   pip install mswordtree

Use the following code to parse your word document in a tree structure

::

   from mswordtree import GetWordDocTree
   root = GetWordDocTree('test.docx')

Now you can iterate over all objects of the document by using the
following code

::

   for item in root.Items:
       print('Type: {} -> Content {}\n'.format(item.Type, item.Content))

To make the json use the following code

::

   from mswordtree import ToString
   ToString([root])
