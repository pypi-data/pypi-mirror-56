EPRsim
======
Open-source simulation package for cw-EPR spectra. 
EPRsim has been developed in the group of Prof. Dr. Stefan Weber at the University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, during the last couple of years. EPRsim was developed by Stephan Rein. The program uses several concepts described in [1].
EPRsim is open-source and available free of charge.

Installation
------------

Install EPRsim via pip:

$ pip install eprsim


Run EPRsim
----------

Call it as package when running Python.

>>> import EPRsim.EPRsim as sim

Define parameters and run the simulation by
invoking the simulate() function of EPRsim.

>>> Param = sim.Parameters()
>>> B, spc, flag = sim.simulate(Param)


The simulate() functions is discribed in the following:

Parameters
----------
Parameters : object
             Object with all simulation parameters.


Returns
-------
field :   numpy.ndarray
          Magnetic field vector

spc :     numpy.ndarray
          Intesity vector of the cw-EPR signal

flag :    list
          Flags with warning codes (description pleas find below)


Notes
------
Main function for the simulation of cw-EPR in different motional regimes
(isotropic, fast-motion and solid state)
All spectra are simulated as field sweep spectra.

Isotropic/fast-motion
For the fast-motion regime/isotropic limit, the program solves
the implicit Breit-Rabi formula [1] in a fixed-point iteration.
Anisotropic line-broadening effects in the fast-motion regime
are calculated via the Kivelson formula [2].
Currently, Euler angles between tensors are ignored by the algorithm!
All tensors (only relevant for fast-motion) need to be in their principal
axis system and colinear to each other.

Solid-state
In the solid-state regime, the program uses a full matrix diagonalization
algorithm. Therefore, only spin systems with a Hilbert space
dimension of dim(H) < 512 can be calculated.
The powder average is partially generated by interpolation
of eigenvalues and transition probabilitites (similar to [1]).
The interpolation level is automatically set by the program.
The solid state algorithm treats arbitrary spin systems as long
as the Hilbert space dimension is within the threshold.
Spin-polarization can be defined (withing the electronic sublevels)
as zero-field populations. The program constructs (sparse) density matrices
out of the zero-field eigenvectors, to efficiently calculate the population
transformation from zero field to high field.
Per default, the program calculates
with thermal equilibrium. Nuclear quadrupolar couplings (for I > 0.5)
are currently not implemented.

The warning codes are:

0: Everything is alright

1: Solid-state is not possible due to too large matrix dimension.

2: Fast-motion/iso is not possible due to S > 1/2.


The Parameter syntax was kept similar to the one used in EasySpin [1],
to make it
