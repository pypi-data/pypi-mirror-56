Please refer to the Travis CI build linked above for the currently
supported combinations of Python and Django.


Installation
============

``pip install django-admin-ordering``, and add ``admin_ordering`` to
``INSTALLED_APPS``.


Usage
=====

First, you need a model ordered by an integer field.


Orderable change lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    from admin_ordering.admin import OrderableAdmin

    @admin.register(MyModel)
    class MyModelAdmin(OrderableAdmin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        # The field used for ordering. Prepend a minus for reverse
        # ordering: "-order"
        ordering_field = "order"

        # You may optionally hide the ordering field in the changelist:
        # ordering_field_hide_input = False

        # The ordering field must be included both in list_display and
        # list_editable:
        list_display = ["name", "order"]
        list_editable = ["order"]


Orderable inlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    from admin_ordering.admin import OrderableAdmin

    class MyModelTabularInline(OrderableAdmin, admin.TabularInline):
        model = MyModel

        # Same as above; "-order" is also allowed here:
        ordering_field = "order"
        # ordering_field_hide_input = False

``OrderableAdmin`` comes with a default of ``extra = 0`` (no extra
empty inlines shown by default). It is strongly recommended to leave the
changed default as-is, because otherwise you'll end up with invalid
inlines just because you wanted to change the ordering.


Limitations
===========

- Starting with Django 1.9 newly created inlines are automatically
  assigned a good ordering value. Earlier versions do not support the
  required ``formset:added`` signal.
- ``OrderableAdmin`` can be used both for inlines and parents, but this
  also means that you cannot register a model directly with
  ``OrderableAdmin``.
- Using django-admin-ordering with filtered or paginated lists may
  produce unexpected results. The workaround right now is to set
  `list_per_page` to a bigger value and not reordering filtered
  changelists.
