    The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have
    before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker
    must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.

    - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

    - **Comparator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a
      Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
      GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it
      to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see
      if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a
      Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the
      user's profile, regardless of its value.

    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

      The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be
      present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the
      Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
      QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
      comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(integer) --*

    - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

      The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid
      ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a
      Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo,
      In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the
      EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the
      NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(dict) --*

        The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

        - **Country** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US
          refers to the United States of America.

        - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

          The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example,
          the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

    - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

      DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
      question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
      this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of
      the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker
      meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such
      requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be
      allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the
      HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded``
      field.

    - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

      Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
      QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept"
      (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results),
      "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their
      search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT
      in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple
      QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute).
      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive
      to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
      QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all
      requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover,
      i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT.
      ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

      The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be
      present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the
      Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
      QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
      comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(integer) --*

    - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

      The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid
      ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a
      Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo,
      In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the
      EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the
      NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(dict) --*

        The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

        - **Country** *(string) --*

          The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US
          refers to the United States of America.

        - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

          The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example,
          the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

    - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

      DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
      question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
      this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of
      the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker
      meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such
      requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be
      allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the
      HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded``
      field.

    - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

      Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
      QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept"
      (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results),
      "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their
      search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT
      in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple
      QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute).
      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive
      to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
      QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all
      requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover,
      i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT.
      ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

      if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a
      Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the
      user's profile, regardless of its value.

    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

      The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be
      present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the
      Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
      QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
      comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(integer) --*

    - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

      The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid
      ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a
      Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo,
      In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the
      EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the
      NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(dict) --*

        The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

        - **Country** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US
          refers to the United States of America.

        - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

          The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example,
          the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

    - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

      DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
      question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
      this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of
      the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker
      meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such
      requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be
      allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the
      HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded``
      field.

    - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

      Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
      QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept"
      (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results),
      "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their
      search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT
      in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple
      QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute).
      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive
      to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
      QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all
      requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover,
      i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT.
      ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

        have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a
        Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search
        results.

        - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --*

          The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

        - **Comparator** *(string) --*

          The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a
          Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
          GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can
          compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You
          can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values.
          Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or
          DoesNotExist in the user's profile, regardless of its value.

        - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

          The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be
          present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the
          Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
          QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
          comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
          structure.

          - *(integer) --*

        - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

          The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a
          valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be
          used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the
          EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue
          element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison
          by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a
          QualificationRequirement data structure.

          - *(dict) --*

            The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

            - **Country** *(string) --*

              The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the
              code US refers to the United States of America.

            - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

              The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For
              example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

        - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

          DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
          question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
          this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet
          all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT.
          If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are
          no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker
          will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and
          complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the
          ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

        - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

          Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
          QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
          "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search
          results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT
          in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview,
          or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with
          multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded
          attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have
          met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least
          restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker
          meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not
          meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
          Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or
          Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the
          ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

    - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --*

      Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview |
      ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.

    - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --*

      The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by
      Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

    - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --*

      The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.

    - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --*

      The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

    The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have
    before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker
    must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.

    - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --*

      The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

    - **Comparator** *(string) --*

      The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a
      Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
      GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it
      to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see
      if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a
      Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the
      user's profile, regardless of its value.

    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

      The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be
      present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the
      Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
      QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
      comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(integer) --*

    - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

      The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid

      Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo,
      In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the
      EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the
      NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

          The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example,
          the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

    - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

      DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
      question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
      this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of
      the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker
      meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such
      requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be
      allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the
      HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded``
      field.

    - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

      Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
      QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept"
      (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results),
      "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their
      search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT
      in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple
      QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute).
      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive
      to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
      QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all
      requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover,
      i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT.
      ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

            question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not
            meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must
            meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the
            HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if
            there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT,
            the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed
            to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in
            combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

          - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

            Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
            QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
            "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their
            search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
            see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot
            accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to
            create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values
            for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform
            an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The
            actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and
            Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to
            DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with
            PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their
            search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should
            not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

                example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

          - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

            DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
            question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not
            meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must
            meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the
            HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if
            there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT,
            the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed
            to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in
            combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

          - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

            Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
            QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
            "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their
            search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
            see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot
            accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to
            create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values
            for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform
            an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The
            actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and
            Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to
            DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with
            PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their
            search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should
            not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

      - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --*

        Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview |
        ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.

      - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --*

        The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by
        Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

      - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --*

        The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.

      - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --*

        The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

    The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have
    before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker
    must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.

    - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --*

      The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

    - **Comparator** *(string) --*

      The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a
      Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
      GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it
      to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see
      if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a
      Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the
      user's profile, regardless of its value.

    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

      The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be
      present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the
      Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
      QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
      comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data
      structure.

      - *(integer) --*

    - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

      The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid
      ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a
      Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo,
      In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the
      EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the
      NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data

          The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example,
          the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

    - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

      DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
      question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
      this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of
      the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker
      meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such
      requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be
      allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the
      HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded``
      field.

    - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

      Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
      QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept"
      (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results),
      "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their
      search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT
      in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple
      QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute).
      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive
      to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
      QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all
      requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover,
      i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT.

    - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --*

      The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

    - **Comparator** *(string) --*

      The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a
      Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
      GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it
      to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see

              true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements
              for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will
              not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not
              be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
              QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
              "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their
              search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
              see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot
              accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to
              create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values
              for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to
              perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the
              action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are
              Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
              QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet
              all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
              Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or
              Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the
              ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

        - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --*

          Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed
          | MarkedForReview |
          ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.

        - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --*

          The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by
          Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

    - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --*

      The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

    - **Comparator** *(string) --*

      The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a
      Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
      GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it
      to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see

    - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

      The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be

      meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such
      requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be
      allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the

      search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT
      in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple
      QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute).
      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive

                  code US refers to the United States of America.

                - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

                  The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For
                  example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

            - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

              DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true,
              the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do
              not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications
              must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to
              preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is
              true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements
              for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will
              not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not
              be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
              QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
              "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their
              search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
              see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot
              accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to
              create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values
              for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to
              perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the
              action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are
              Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
              QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet
              all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
              Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or
              Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the
              ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

        - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --*

          Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed
          | MarkedForReview |
          ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.

        - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --*

          The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by
          Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

      GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it
      to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see

      In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
      QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive

              compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue.
              You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue
              values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or
              DoesNotExist in the user's profile, regardless of its value.

            - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

              The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not

              must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to
              preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is
              true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements
              for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will
              not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not

            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
              QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
              "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their
              search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
              see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot
              accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to
              create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values
              for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to
              perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the
              action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are
              Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
              QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet
              all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
              Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or
              Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the

            The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

            - **Country** *(string) --*

              The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the
              code US refers to the United States of America.

            - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

              The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For
              example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

        - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

          DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the
          question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet
          this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet
          all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT.
          If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are
          no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker
          will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and
          complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the
          ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

        - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

          Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
          QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
          "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search
          results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT
          in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview,
          or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with
          multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded
          attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have
          met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least
          restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker
          meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not
          meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
          Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or
          Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the
          ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

    - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --*

      Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview |
      ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.

    - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --*

      Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

    - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --*

      The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.

    - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --*

      The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.

          only to the creator of the HIT.

        - **QualificationRequirements** *(list) --*

          Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can
          have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in
          order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using
          the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure.

          - *(dict) --*

            The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must
            have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state

              You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue
              values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or
              DoesNotExist in the user's profile, regardless of its value.

            - **IntegerValues** *(list) --*

              The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not

              be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if
              the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale
              QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn
              comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement
              data structure.

              - *(integer) --*

            - **LocaleValues** *(list) --*

              The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be
              a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can
              only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used
              with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single
              LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing
              a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30
              LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.

              - *(dict) --*

                The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

                - **Country** *(string) --*

                  The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the
                  code US refers to the United States of America.

                - **Subdivision** *(string) --*

                  The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For
                  example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

            - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --*

              DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true,
              the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do
              not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications
              must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to
              preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is
              true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements
              for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will
              not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not
              be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --*

              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this
              QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include
              "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their
              search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
              see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot
              accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to
              create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values
              for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to
              perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the
              action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are
              Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
              QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet
              all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to
              Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or
              Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the
              ``RequiredToPreview`` field.

        - **HITReviewStatus** *(string) --*

          Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed
          | MarkedForReview |
          ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.

        - **NumberOfAssignmentsPending** *(integer) --*

          The number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by
          Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.

        - **NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable** *(integer) --*

          The number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.

        - **NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted** *(integer) --*

          The number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.
