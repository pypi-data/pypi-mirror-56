StackImpact Python Profiler
===========================

Overview
--------

StackImpact is a production-grade performance profiler built for both
production and development environments. It gives developers continuous
and historical code-level view of application performance that is
essential for locating CPU, memory allocation and I/O hot spots as well
as latency bottlenecks. Included runtime metrics and error monitoring
complement profiles for extensive performance analysis. Learn more at
`stackimpact.com <https://stackimpact.com/>`__.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  Continuous hot spot profiling of CPU usage, memory allocation and
   blocking calls.
-  Error and exception monitoring.
-  Health monitoring including CPU, memory, garbage collection and other
   runtime metrics.
-  Alerts on profile anomalies.
-  Team access.

Learn more on the `features <https://stackimpact.com/features/>`__ page
(with screenshots).

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The StackImpact profiler agent is imported into a program and used as a
normal package. When the program runs, various sampling profilers are
started and stopped automatically by the agent and/or programmatically
using the agent methods. The agent periodically reports recorded
profiles and metrics to the StackImpact Dashboard. The agent can also
operate in manual mode, which should be used in development only.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See full `documentation <https://stackimpact.com/docs/>`__ for
reference.

Supported environment
---------------------

-  Linux, OS X or Windows. Python version 2.7, 3.4 or higher.
-  Memory allocation profiler and some GC metrics are only available for
   Python 3.
-  Profilers only support Linux and OS X.
-  Time (blocking call) profiler supports threads and gevent.
-  On unix systems the profilers use the following signals: SIGPROF,
   SIGALRM, SIGUSR2. Only SIGUSR2 is handled transparently, i.e. it
   should not conflict with previousely registered handlers.

Getting started
---------------

Create StackImpact account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sign up for a free trial account at
`stackimpact.com <https://stackimpact.com>`__ (also with GitHub login).

Installing the agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the Python agent by running

::

    pip install stackimpact

And import the package in your application

.. code:: python

    import stackimpact

Configuring the agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start the agent in the main thread by specifying the agent key and
application name. The agent key can be found in your account's
Configuration section.

.. code:: python

    agent = stackimpact.start(
        agent_key = 'agent key here',
        app_name = 'MyPythonApp')

Add the agent initialization to the worker code, e.g. wsgi.py, if
applicable.

All initialization options:

-  ``agent_key`` (Required) The access key for communication with the
   StackImpact servers.
-  ``app_name`` (Required) A name to identify and group application
   data. Typically, a single codebase, deployable unit or executable
   module corresponds to one application.
-  ``app_version`` (Optional) Sets application version, which can be
   used to associate profiling information with the source code release.
-  ``app_environment`` (Optional) Used to differentiate applications in
   different environments.
-  ``host_name`` (Optional) By default, host name will be the OS
   hostname.
-  ``auto_profiling`` (Optional) If set to ``False``, disables automatic
   profiling and reporting. Focused or manual profiling should be used
   instead. Useful for environments without support for timers or
   background tasks.
-  ``debug`` (Optional) Enables debug logging.
-  ``cpu_profiler_disabled``, ``allocation_profiler_disabled``,
   ``block_profiler_disabled``, ``error_profiler_disabled`` (Optional)
   Disables respective profiler when ``True``.
-  ``include_agent_frames`` (Optional) Set to ``True`` to not exclude
   agent stack frames from profile call graphs.
-  ``auto_destroy`` (Optional) Set to ``False`` to disable agent's exit
   handlers. If necessary, call ``destroy()`` to gracefully shutdown the
   agent.

Focused profiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``agent.profile(name)`` to instruct the agent when to start and stop
profiling. The agent decides if and which profiler is activated.
Normally, this method should be used in repeating code, such as request
or event handlers. In addition to more precise profiling, timing
information will also be reported for the profiled spans. Usage example:

.. code:: python

    span = agent.profile('span1');

    # your code here

    span.stop();

Alternatively, a ``with`` statement can be used:

.. code:: python

    with agent.profile('span1'):
        # your code ehere

Manual profiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Manual profiling should not be used in production!*

By default, the agent starts and stops profiling automatically. Manual
profiling allows to start and stop profilers directly. It is suitable
for profiling short-lived programs and should not be used for
long-running production applications. Automatic profiling should be
disabled with ``auto_profiling: False``.

.. code:: python

    # Start CPU profiler.
    agent.start_cpu_profiler();

.. code:: python

    # Stop CPU profiler and report the recorded profile to the Dashboard.
    agent.stop_cpu_profiler();

.. code:: python

    # Start blocking call profiler.
    agent.start_block_profiler();

.. code:: python

    # Stop blocking call profiler and report the recorded profile to the Dashboard.
    agent.stop_block_profiler();

.. code:: python

    # Start heap allocation profiler.
    agent.start_allocation_profiler();

.. code:: python

    # Stop heap allocation profiler and report the recorded profile to the Dashboard.
    agent.stop_allocation_profiler();

Analyzing performance data in the Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your application is restarted, you can start observing continuous
CPU, memory, I/O, and other hot spot profiles, execution bottlenecks as
well as process metrics in the
`Dashboard <https://dashboard.stackimpact.com/>`__.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable debug logging, add ``debug = True`` to startup options. If the
debug log doesn't give you any hints on how to fix a problem, please
report it to our support team in your account's Support section.

Overhead
--------

The agent overhead is measured to be less than 1% for applications under
high load.
