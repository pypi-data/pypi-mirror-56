Description: SikulPy
        -------
        
        Sikuli[1] is pretty awesome, but it requires java. Bleh.
        
        This is a project to provide the same API using regular CPython libraries.
        
        The goal is to be able to run any script which works in the Java IDE.
        
        Installation:
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/shish/sikulpy
        $ cd sikulpy
        $ python3.7 -m venv .env
        $ . .env/bin/activate
        $ pip install -e ./
        $ sikulpy ~/Documents/sikuli/foo.sikuli
        ```

        Java-Sikuli compatibility
        -------------------------
        The parts of the Sikuli API that I'm personally using are fairly stable; I'm using it in production on Linux, with development on OSX and occasional testing on Windows.
        
        Parts of the API which are known to be incomplete have tasks filed here: https://github.com/shish/sikulpy/labels/API%20Completion
