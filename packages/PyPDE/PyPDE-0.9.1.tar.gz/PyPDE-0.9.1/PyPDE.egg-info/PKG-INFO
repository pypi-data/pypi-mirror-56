        UNDER DEVELOPMENT
        =================
        
        A Python library for solving any system of hyperbolic/parabolic PDEs, with potentially stiff source terms and non-conservative components (e.g. Navier-Stokes, reactive Euler, Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski, etc.)
        
        * Based on the ADER-WENO method
        * C++ under the hood for speed
        * Your fluxes and sources written in Python for ease
