UNDER DEVELOPMENT
=================

A Python library for solving any system of hyperbolic/parabolic PDEs, with potentially stiff source terms and non-conservative components (e.g. Navier-Stokes, reactive Euler, Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski, etc.)

* Based on the ADER-WENO method
* C++ under the hood for speed
* Your fluxes and sources written in Python for ease

Please feel free to take a look and message me with suggestions. Please don't
fork anything until the first functioning release.
