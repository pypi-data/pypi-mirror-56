Description: asgi_amqp
        ==========
        
        An ASGI channel layer that uses AMQP as its backing store with group support.
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        The `asgi_amqp` channel layer looks for settings in `ASGI_AMQP` and
        has the following configuration options. URL and connection settings
        are configured through `CHANNEL_LAYER` same as any channel layer.
        
        **MODEL**
        Set a custom `ChannelGroup` model to use. See more about this in the ChannelGroup
        Model section of this README.
        
        Usage::
        
            ASGI_AMQP = {'MODEL': 'awx.main.models.channels.ChannelGroup'}
        
        **INIT_FUNC**
        A function that you want run when the channel layer is first instantiated.
        
        Usage::
        
            ASGI_AMQP = {'INIT_FUNC': 'awx.prepare_env'}
        
        
        ChannelGroup Model
        ------------------
        
        This channel layer requires a database model called `ChannelGroup`. You
        can use the model and migation provided by adding `asgi_amqp` to your
        installed apps or you can point the `ASGI_AMQP.MODEL` setting to a
        model you have already defined.
        
        Installed Apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'asgi_amqp',
                ...
            ]
        
        Settings::
        
            ASGI_AMQP = {
                'MODEL': 'awx.main.models.channels.ChannelGroup',
            }
