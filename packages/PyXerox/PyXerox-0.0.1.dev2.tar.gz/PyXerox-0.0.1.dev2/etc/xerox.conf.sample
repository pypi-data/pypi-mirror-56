# Default value is False (fully disable the profiling feature).

#   operations. If the profiling is triggered by another project, this project

# Enable SQL requests profiling in services.
#
# Default value is False (SQL requests won't be traced).
#
# Possible values:
#
# * True: Enables SQL requests profiling. Each SQL query will be part of the
#   trace and can the be analyzed by how much time was spent for that.
# * False: Disables SQL requests profiling. The spent time is only shown on a

#
# This string value should have the following format:
# <key1>[,<key2>,...<keyn>],
# where each key is some random string. A user who triggers the profiling via
# the REST API has to set one of these keys in the headers of the REST API call
# to include profiling results of this node for this particular project.
#
# Both "enabled" flag and "hmac_keys" config options should be set to enable
# profiling. Also, to generate correct profiling information across all
# services
# at least one key needs to be consistent between OpenStack projects. This
# ensures it can be used from client side to generate the trace, containing

# Connection string for a notifier backend.

# Default value is ``messaging://`` which sets the notifier to oslo_messaging.

#
# * ``messaging://`` - use oslo_messaging driver for sending spans.
# * ``redis://127.0.0.1:6379`` - use redis driver for sending spans.
# * ``mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`` - use mongodb driver for sending spans.
# * ``elasticsearch://127.0.0.1:9200`` - use elasticsearch driver for sending

#
# This parameter is a time value parameter (for example: es_scroll_time=2m),

#
# Redissentinel uses a service name to identify a master redis service.

# Enable filter traces that contain error/exception to a separated place.
#

# If set to true, this enables the oslo debug middleware in Xerox. This
# Middleware prints a lot of information about the request and the response. It
# is useful for getting information about the data on the wire (decoded) and
# passed to the WSGI application pipeline. This middleware has no effect on the
# "debug" setting in the [DEFAULT] section of the config file or setting
# Xerox's log-level to "DEBUG"; it is specific to debugging the WSGI data as it
# enters and leaves Xerox (specific request-related data). This option is used
# for introspection on the request and response data between the web server
# (apache, nginx, etc) and Xerox.  This middleware is inserted as the first
# element in the middleware chain and will show the data closest to the wire.
# WARNING: NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN PRODUCTION. THIS MIDDLEWARE CAN AND WILL
# EMIT SENSITIVE/PRIVILEGED DATA. (boolean value)
