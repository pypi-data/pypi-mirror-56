    Type definition for `ClientPostContent` `Response`

    - **contentType** *(string) --*

      Content type as specified in the ``Accept`` HTTP header in the request.

    - **intentName** *(string) --*

      Current user intent that Amazon Lex is aware of.

    - **slots** (JSON serializable) --

      Map of zero or more intent slots (name/value pairs) Amazon Lex detected from the user input
      during the conversation. The field is base-64 encoded.

      Amazon Lex creates a resolution list containing likely values for a slot. The value that it
      returns is determined by the ``valueSelectionStrategy`` selected when the slot type was
      created or updated. If ``valueSelectionStrategy`` is set to ``ORIGINAL_VALUE`` , the value
      provided by the user is returned, if the user value is similar to the slot values. If
      ``valueSelectionStrategy`` is set to ``TOP_RESOLUTION`` Amazon Lex returns the first value in
      the resolution list or, if there is no resolution list, null. If you don't specify a
      ``valueSelectionStrategy`` , the default is ``ORIGINAL_VALUE`` .

    - **sessionAttributes** (JSON serializable) --

      Map of key/value pairs representing the session-specific context information.

    - **sentimentResponse** *(string) --*

      The sentiment expressed in and utterance.

      When the bot is configured to send utterances to Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis,
      this field contains the result of the analysis.

    - **message** *(string) --*

      The message to convey to the user. The message can come from the bot's configuration or from
      a Lambda function.

      If the intent is not configured with a Lambda function, or if the Lambda function returned
      ``Delegate`` as the ``dialogAction.type`` in its response, Amazon Lex decides on the next
      course of action and selects an appropriate message from the bot's configuration based on the
      current interaction context. For example, if Amazon Lex isn't able to understand user input,
      it uses a clarification prompt message.

      When you create an intent you can assign messages to groups. When messages are assigned to
      groups Amazon Lex returns one message from each group in the response. The message field is
      an escaped JSON string containing the messages. For more information about the structure of
      the JSON string returned, see  msg-prompts-formats .

      If the Lambda function returns a message, Amazon Lex passes it to the client in its response.

    - **messageFormat** *(string) --*

      The format of the response message. One of the following values:

      * ``PlainText`` - The message contains plain UTF-8 text.

      * ``CustomPayload`` - The message is a custom format for the client.

      * ``SSML`` - The message contains text formatted for voice output.

      * ``Composite`` - The message contains an escaped JSON object containing one or more messages
      from the groups that messages were assigned to when the intent was created.

    - **dialogState** *(string) --*

      Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex returns one of the following
      values as ``dialogState`` . The client can optionally use this information to customize the
      user interface.

      * ``ElicitIntent`` - Amazon Lex wants to elicit the user's intent. Consider the following
      examples:  For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If Amazon
      Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will return this dialog state.

      * ``ConfirmIntent`` - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no" response.  For example, Amazon
      Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an intent. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no"
      response, a user might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it a
      thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink." Amazon Lex can process such additional
      information (in these examples, update the crust type slot or change the intent from
      OrderPizza to OrderDrink).

      * ``ElicitSlot`` - Amazon Lex is expecting the value of a slot for the current intent.  For
      example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message: "What size pizza would
      you like?". A user might reply with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also
      provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex
      can process such additional information appropriately.

      * ``Fulfilled`` - Conveys that the Lambda function has successfully fulfilled the intent.

      * ``ReadyForFulfillment`` - Conveys that the client has to fulfill the request.

      * ``Failed`` - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.  This can happen for
      various reasons, including that the user does not provide an appropriate response to prompts
      from the service (you can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for specific
      information), or if the Lambda function fails to fulfill the intent.

    - **slotToElicit** *(string) --*

      If the ``dialogState`` value is ``ElicitSlot`` , returns the name of the slot for which
      Amazon Lex is eliciting a value.

    - **inputTranscript** *(string) --*

      The text used to process the request.

      If the input was an audio stream, the ``inputTranscript`` field contains the text extracted
      from the audio stream. This is the text that is actually processed to recognize intents and
      slot values. You can use this information to determine if Amazon Lex is correctly processing
      the audio that you send.

    - **audioStream** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) --

      The prompt (or statement) to convey to the user. This is based on the bot configuration and
      context. For example, if Amazon Lex did not understand the user intent, it sends the
      ``clarificationPrompt`` configured for the bot. If the intent requires confirmation before
      taking the fulfillment action, it sends the ``confirmationPrompt`` . Another example: Suppose
      that the Lambda function successfully fulfilled the intent, and sent a message to convey to
      the user. Then Amazon Lex sends that message in the response.

    - **intentName** *(string) --*

      The current user intent that Amazon Lex is aware of.

    - **slots** *(dict) --*

      The intent slots that Amazon Lex detected from the user input in the conversation.

      Amazon Lex creates a resolution list containing likely values for a slot. The value that it
      returns is determined by the ``valueSelectionStrategy`` selected when the slot type was
      created or updated. If ``valueSelectionStrategy`` is set to ``ORIGINAL_VALUE`` , the value
      provided by the user is returned, if the user value is similar to the slot values. If
      ``valueSelectionStrategy`` is set to ``TOP_RESOLUTION`` Amazon Lex returns the first value in
      the resolution list or, if there is no resolution list, null. If you don't specify a
      ``valueSelectionStrategy`` , the default is ``ORIGINAL_VALUE`` .

      - *(string) --*

      A map of key-value pairs representing the session-specific context information.

      - *(string) --*

        - *(string) --*

    - **message** *(string) --*

      The message to convey to the user. The message can come from the bot's configuration or from
      a Lambda function.

      If the intent is not configured with a Lambda function, or if the Lambda function returned
      ``Delegate`` as the ``dialogAction.type`` its response, Amazon Lex decides on the next course
      of action and selects an appropriate message from the bot's configuration based on the
      current interaction context. For example, if Amazon Lex isn't able to understand user input,
      it uses a clarification prompt message.

      When you create an intent you can assign messages to groups. When messages are assigned to
      groups Amazon Lex returns one message from each group in the response. The message field is
      an escaped JSON string containing the messages. For more information about the structure of
      the JSON string returned, see  msg-prompts-formats .

      If the Lambda function returns a message, Amazon Lex passes it to the client in its response.

    - **sentimentResponse** *(dict) --*

      The sentiment expressed in and utterance.

      When the bot is configured to send utterances to Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis,
      this field contains the result of the analysis.

      - **sentimentLabel** *(string) --*

        The inferred sentiment that Amazon Comprehend has the highest confidence in.

      - **sentimentScore** *(string) --*

        The likelihood that the sentiment was correctly inferred.

    - **messageFormat** *(string) --*

      The format of the response message. One of the following values:

      * ``PlainText`` - The message contains plain UTF-8 text.

      * ``CustomPayload`` - The message is a custom format defined by the Lambda function.

      * ``SSML`` - The message contains text formatted for voice output.

      * ``Composite`` - The message contains an escaped JSON object containing one or more messages
      from the groups that messages were assigned to when the intent was created.

    - **dialogState** *(string) --*

      Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex returns one of the following
      values as ``dialogState`` . The client can optionally use this information to customize the
      user interface.

      * ``ElicitIntent`` - Amazon Lex wants to elicit user intent.  For example, a user might utter
      an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this
      utterance, it will return this dialogState.

      * ``ConfirmIntent`` - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no" response.  For example, Amazon
      Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an intent.  Instead of a simple "yes" or "no,"
      a user might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it thick crust
      pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink". Amazon Lex can process such additional information
      (in these examples, update the crust type slot value, or change intent from OrderPizza to
      OrderDrink).

      * ``ElicitSlot`` - Amazon Lex is expecting a slot value for the current intent.  For example,
      suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message: "What size pizza would you
      like?". A user might reply with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also provide
      additional information in the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can
      process such additional information appropriately.

      * ``Fulfilled`` - Conveys that the Lambda function configured for the intent has successfully
      fulfilled the intent.

      * ``ReadyForFulfillment`` - Conveys that the client has to fulfill the intent.

      * ``Failed`` - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.  This can happen for
      various reasons including that the user did not provide an appropriate response to prompts
      from the service (you can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for specific
      information), or the Lambda function failed to fulfill the intent.

    - **slotToElicit** *(string) --*

      If the ``dialogState`` value is ``ElicitSlot`` , returns the name of the slot for which
      Amazon Lex is eliciting a value.

    - **responseCard** *(dict) --*

      Represents the options that the user has to respond to the current prompt. Response Card can
      come from the bot configuration (in the Amazon Lex console, choose the settings button next
      to a slot) or from a code hook (Lambda function).

      - **version** *(string) --*

        The version of the response card format.

      - **contentType** *(string) --*

        The content type of the response.
