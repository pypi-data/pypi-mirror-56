# Specification

Configuration is provided by sets of `yaml` files organized hierarchically by organization name. For example,
`nist.trec.documents.clueweb09` can be found in the file `nist/trec/documents.yaml`. The path `nist/trec` defines the organization.

Each `yaml` file contains one or more documents. The first one is the main dataset, the others (optionals) are derivatives. This is useful when various versions of a dataset exists (or various view on the dataset exist).

## Format

### Example

The following is a complete example that describes the Glove dataset

```yaml
name: GloVe word embeddings
website: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
license: Public Domain Dedication and License
data:
  - word embeddings
papers:
  technical description: http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf
description: |
  GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.
  Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus,
  and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.

## Fields

### General information

- `abstract` flag used to mark an abstract dataset (sub-datasets have to be defined)
- `name` gives a short name of the dataset
- `description` gives a longer description of the dataset
- `data`, `tasks`, and `tags` is a list of tags (free vocabulary) that are respectively considered as data (e.g. "image", "caption"), tasks (e.g. "collaborative filtering"), or free (all the other tags that can describe the dataset)
- `date` is the dataset release date 
- `version` is the version of the dataset
- [`links`](#links) give links to the main website or other related resources (e.g. paper)


### Links

`links` is a dictionary that associates a name with some fields like

- `url` The URL of the link
- `type` Gives the type of resource: either `website` or `paper`

### Download and data

The field `download` specifies how data should be downloaded. Generic handlers are defined
in datamaestro ([see documentation](../download)) or defined in datamaestro extensions.

The field `files` specifies [file formats](../files)
