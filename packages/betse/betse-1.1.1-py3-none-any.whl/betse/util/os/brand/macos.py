_SECURITY_FRAMEWORK_DYLIB_FILENAME = (

'''
Absolute path of the system-wide `Security.framework` Macho-O shared library
providing the macOS-specific security context for the current process.

This library is dynamically loadable into the address space of the current
process with the :class:`ctypes.CDLL` class. Since all Macho-O shared libraries
necessarily have the filetype `dylib`, this filetype is safely omitted here.
'''


_SECURITY_SESSION_ID_CURRENT = -1
'''
Magic integer defined as `callerSecuritySession` by the macOS-specific
`/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.Framework/Headers/AuthSession.h` C header
suitable for passing to C functions accepting parameters of C type
`SecuritySessionId` (e.g., `SessionGetInfo()`).

When passed, this integer signifies the **current security session** (i.e., the
the security session to which the current process belongs).

    C header defining this magic integer.
'''


_SECURITY_SESSION_HAS_GRAPHIC_ACCESS = 0x0010
'''
Bit flag defined as `sessionHasGraphicAccess` by the macOS-specific
`/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.Framework/Headers/AuthSession.h` C header
masking the attributes bit field returned by the `SessionGetInfo()` C function
also declared by that header.

When enabled, this bit signifies the current process to have access to the Aqua
display server and hence be headfull (rather than headless).
