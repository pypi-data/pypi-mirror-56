**Enumeration types** (i.e., :class:`enum.Enum` subclasses) required to express

'''
Enumeration of all supported types of **base cell lattices** (i.e., uniform grid
to which cells are situated *before* random lattice disorder is applied).

Attributes
----------
HEX : enum
    Hexagonal base cell lattice, situating cells along a hexagonal grid.
SQUARE : enum
    Rectilinear base cell lattice, situating cells along a square grid.

'''
Enumeration of all supported types of **tissue profile pickers** (i.e., objects
assigning a subset of all cells matching some criteria to the corresponding
tissue profile).

Attributes
----------
ALL : enum
    All-inclusive tissue picker, unconditionally matching *all* cells.
IMAGE : enum
    Image-based tissue picker, matching all cells residing inside the colored
    pixel area defined by an associated on-disk image mask file.
INDICES : enum
    Cell indices-based tissue picker, matching all cells whose indices are
    defined by a given sequence.
PERCENT : enum
    Randomized cell picker, randomly matching a given percentage of all cells.

GrnUnpicklePhaseType = make_enum(

'''
Enumeration of all supported types of gene regulatory network (GRN)-specific
**unpickle simulation phases** (i.e., previously pickled simulation phase to
unpickle as the computational basis for the current network to be run by the
``betse sim-grn`` subcommand).

Attributes
----------
SEED : enum
    Unpickled seed phase, running this network on the results of a previously
    run ``betse seed`` subcommand and hence an uninitialized and unsimulated
    cell cluster (i.e., neither initialized to steady-state concentrations *nor*
    simulated with non-steady-state bioelectrical phenomena).
INIT : enum
    Unpickled initialization phase, running this network on the results of a
    previously run ``betse init`` subcommand and hence an initialized but
    unsimulated cell cluster.
SIM : enum
    Unpickled simulation phase, running this network on the results of a
    previously run ``betse sim`` subcommand and hence an initialized and
    simulated cell cluster.

IonProfileType = make_enum(

'''
Enumeration of all supported types of **ion profiles** (i.e., predefined sets of
all extracellular and cytosolic ions enabled by this simulation).

Note that *all* ion profiles unconditionally enable an unidentified
charge-balance anion denoted M-, as required for both simulation stability and
correctness.

Attributes
----------
BASIC : enum
    Ion profile enabling M-, Na+, K+, and proteins- ions. This profile is the
    proper subset of all other predefined ion profiles.
BASIC_CA : enum
    Ion profile enabling M-, Na+, K+, proteins-, and Ca2+ ions. This profile is
    the superset of the :attr:`BASIC` profile enabling Ca2+ ions.
MAMMAL : enum
    Ion profile enabling M-, Na+, K+, proteins-, Ca2+, Cl-, and H+ ions
    expressed in amniotic environmental concentrations, principally intended for
    mammalian cell clusters. This profile is the superset of the
    :attr:`BASIC_CA` profile enabling Cl- and H+ ions.
AMPHIBIAN : enum
    Ion profile enabling M-, Na+, K+, proteins-, Ca2+, Cl-, and H+ ions
    expressed in aquatic environmental concentrations, principally intended for
    amphibian cell clusters. This profile enables the same ions as the
    :attr:`MAMMAL` profile -- albeit in differing concentrations.
CUSTOM : enum
    User-defined ion profile. See the
    :attr:`betse.science.parameters.Parameters.ions_custom` variable.

# ....................{ ENUMS ~ solver                     }....................
SolverType = make_enum(
    class_name='SolverType',
    member_names=('FULL', 'FAST',))
'''
Enumeration of all supported types of **simulation solvers** (i.e.,
computational technique iteratively computing each time step of a simulation).

Attributes
----------
FULL : enum
    Accurate but space- and time-inefficient (i.e., slow) solver based on the
    complete BETSE formalism. This solver produces publication-quality results,
    comprehensively simulating all bioelectrical phenomena expected of
    real-world biological systems.
FAST : enum
    Inaccurate but space- and time-efficient (i.e., fast) solver based on the
    well-known equivalent circuit formalism. This solver produces draft-quality
    results, analogizing real-world biological systems to electronic circuits.
    While integrated with gene regulatory networks (GRNs), this solver *cannot*
    by definition simulate the following phenomena simulated by the full solver:
    * Bioelectric fields or currents.
    * Extracellular voltages or voltage polarities.
    * Ion concentrations.
    If this solver is selected, these phenomena are silently ignored even if
    otherwise enabled by the current simulation configuration.
