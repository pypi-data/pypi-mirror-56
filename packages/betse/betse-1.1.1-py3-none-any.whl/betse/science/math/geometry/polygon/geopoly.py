def orient_counterclockwise(polygon: SequenceTypes) -> SequenceTypes:
    '''
    Positively reorient the passed polygon, returning a copy of this polygon
    whose vertices are **positively oriented** (i.e., sorted in
    counter-clockwise order).

    Parameters
    ----------
    polygon : SequenceTypes
        Two-dimensional sequence of all points defining the possibly non-convex
        two-dimensional polygon to be positively oriented such that:
        * The first dimension indexes each such point (in arbitrary order).
        * The second dimension indexes each coordinate of this point such that:
          * The first item is the X coordinate of this point.
          * The second item is the Y coordinate of this point.
        Note that this function expects the type of this sequence to define an
        ``__init__()`` method accepting a passed iterable as its first and only
        positional argument. Unsurprisingly, all builtin sequences (e.g.,
        :class:`tuple`, :class:`list`) *and* :mod:`numpy` sequences (e.g.,
        :class:`numpy.ndarray`) satisfy this requirement.

    Returns
    ----------
    SequenceTypes
        Copy of this polygon positively oriented. The type of this sequence is
        the same as that of the original polygon.
