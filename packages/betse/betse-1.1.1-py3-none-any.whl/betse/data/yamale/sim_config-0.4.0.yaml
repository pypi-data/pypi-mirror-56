# Yamale-based schema validating YAML-formatted BETSE simulation configuration
# files conforming to a specific BETSE version.
#
# For simplicity, the version validated by this schema is embedded directly in
# the basename of this file (e.g., version 0.4.0 for the basename
# "sim_config-0.4.0.yaml").

# Subdocuments
# ---------------------------------
# Each of the following subdocuments (i.e., "---"-prefixed blocks of YAML markup)
# is a Yamale include intended to be included in the above main document via the
# Yamale-specific include() validator. Each include validates a type of block of
# YAML markup repeated throughout the above main document (e.g., bitmaps).
#
# Bitmap
# ---------------------------------
# External image file, usually intended for use as a bitmap mask.
