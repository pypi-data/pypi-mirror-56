    ----------
    match_name : str
        Python-evaluatable expression (e.g., ``'test_method or test other'``)
        conditionally matching a substring of the name of each test function or
        class to be run if any *or* `None` if all tests are to be run
        unconditionally.
    _pytest_public : PackageType
        Top-level public :mod:`pytest` package, imported by the :meth:`run`
        method.
    _pytest_private : PackageType
        Top-level private :mod:`_pytest` package, imported by the :meth:`run`
        method.

    List specifying command-line options accepted by this command.

    Each item of this list is a 3-tuple ``(long_name, short_name, synopsis)``
    specifying a single option, where:

    * ``long_name`` is this option's mandatory GNU-style long form excluding
      ``--`` prefix. Additionally:

      * If this option accepts a mandatory argument, this long form should be
        suffixed by ``=``.
      * Else, this long form should *not* be suffixed by ``=``.

    * ``short_name`` is either:

      * This option's option *NIX-style short form excluding ``-`` prefix.
      * ``None`` if this option has no such form.

    * ``synopsis`` is this option's mandatory help documentation.

    For each such option, an attribute of the same name as this option's long
    form *must* be explicitly initialized in the :meth:`initialize_options`
    method. :mod:`setuptools` fails to recognize options for which this is

        module, providing programmatic access to the CLI implementation of
        :mod:`pytest`. While :mod:`pytest` is also runnable as an external
        command, doing so invites non-trivial complications. Unlike most Python
        applications (e.g., PyInstaller), :mod:`pytest` is *not* dynamically
        importable via the following import machinery:

        Attempting to do so reliably raises exceptions resembling:

            AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__path__'

        The reason why appears to be package ``__path__`` manipulations
        dynamically performed by the private :mod:`_pytest` package. Sadly,
        attempting to import :func:`_pytest.main` fails with an even more
        inscrutable exception. The solution, of course, is to brute-force it
        by only dynamically importing the root :mod:`pytest` package.
