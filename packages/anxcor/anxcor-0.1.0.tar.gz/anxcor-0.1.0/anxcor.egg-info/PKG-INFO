        ## ANXCOR: Ambient Noise X (cross) Correlation
        
        ## *Currently in Beta!*
        
        **ANXCOR** is a python library for performing seismic ambient noise crosscorrelations.
        
        ANXCOR's goal is to provide a framework to reproduce academic studies, rapididly prototype experimental workflows,
        and produce medium-sized arrays of seismic noise cross-correlations. Anxcor was designed from the outset with readability and explicit documentation in mind, with the overall architecture following most of the practices outlined in the [Clean Code Handbook by Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).
        
        
        ANXCOR integrates seamlessly into the current python datascience stack by leveraging common datascience packages 
        like [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org), 
        as well as the popular seismology package [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki). 
        Furthermore, we leverage both [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and [dask](http://dask.org)
        to achieve embarassingly parallel execution. Use of these popular packages makes working with ANXCOR intuitive,
        concise, and extensible without deep domain experience in compiled languages.

        ## Acknowledgements
        Kevin A. Mendoza served as chief architect and programmer of ANXCOR. Development of the project was inspired by Dr. Fan-Chi Lin's work in Ambient Noise Seismic Tomography. Many of the routines implemented here were written after careful consultation with him and his Graduate Student work group (However, none of their code was copied or directly translated into anxcor).

        ## Known Issues
        
        * Using obsplus Wavebank creates runtime race condition on hdf5 table reading, causing index corruption. Error not encountered if restricting workers to a single thread.
        
        * Returned DataSet requires some unravelling to properly plot. 
        ## Planned Enhancements
        
        - FTAN and beamforming routines
        
        ## Contributing
        Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
        
        Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
