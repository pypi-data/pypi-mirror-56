        Machine learning tools for the Geoscience Australia uncover project.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Before you start, make sure your system has the following packages installed,
        
        - gdal (libgdal-dev)
        - openmpi
        - hdf5
        
        We strongly recommend using a virtual environment.
        To install, simply run ``setup.py``:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ python setup.py install
        
        or install with ``pip``:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ pip install git+https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/uncover-ml.git@release
        
        The python requirements should automatically be built and installed.
        
        Cubist
        ------
        
        In order to use the cubist regressor, you need to first make sure cubist is
        installed. This is easy with our simple installation script, invoke it with:
        
        .. code:: console
            
            $ ./makecubist <installation-path>
        
        Once cubist is installed, it will add a configuration file to the script,
        if you like, you can test that it's been installed in the correct place by
        checking the contents of `uncover-ml/cubist_config.py`, its presence
        indicates that the installation completed successfully.
        
        Next you need to rerun the setup script with:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Which will ensure the cubist_config has been added successfully. Now you
        should be able to use the cubist regressor in the pipeline file.
