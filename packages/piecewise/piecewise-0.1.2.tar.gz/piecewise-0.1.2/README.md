# Piecewise

## What is Piecewise?
A Michigan-style Learning Classifier System (LCS) library, written in Python.

It makes heavy use of object-oriented language features to provide a modular,
extensible framework on which to build LCS algorithms.

The currently implemented algorithms are:
1. XCS (ternary rule representation)
2. XCSR (centre-spread rule representation)

## Project Philosophy
The primary use case of Piecewise is for LCS researchers who are interested in:
1. Investigating modifications or extensions to existing LCS algorithms.
2. Running experiments with LCS algorithms on common environments, through a
   standardised and easy-to-use interface.
