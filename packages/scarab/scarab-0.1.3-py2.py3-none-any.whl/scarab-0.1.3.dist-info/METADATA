# Overview
scarab is a CLI tool to automate some of the Bugzilla-related workflows in the FreeBSD project.

# Installation

# Install python3 and pip 
sudo pkg install python3 py36-pip

# Install latest release of scarab
pip-3.6 install --user scarab
# .. or current WIP
git clone https://github.com/gonzoua/scarab.git
cd scarab
pip-3.6 install --user -e .

# Add ~/.local/bin to PATH
# for bash:

# Settings
scarab config file has a generic section-based INI format. A section starts with [sectionname]  and consists of key/value pairs separated by "=". Value is the part of the line after "=" with leading and trailing spaces removed.  If there are spaces in the middle of the string, they're treated as a part of the value.

## [default] section

### url

Base URL  for Bugzilla setup. By default, it's FreeBSD's Bugzilla instance https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/

### api_key

API key for the operations. Normally commands that do not modify Bugzilla's state like `fetch`, `fetchall`, `file` do not require it, unless you're trying to access PRs with restricted access. To generate new API key login to your Bugzilla instance, click on "Preferences" link then select "API keys" tab, check "Generate a new API key ..." checkbox, provide an optional description and click "Submit Changes"

## [template:NNN] sections

Templates are sets of fields that you can use when submitting new PRs instead of specifying them individually as command-line arguments. Valid keys for this kind of section are: `product`, `component`, `version`, `platform`, `severity`. Possible values depend on the actual Bugzilla instance configuration. Some of them can be inspected using `products` command. The part of the section name after the colon is used as an argument to `-t` switch of the `submit` command as a shorthand for multiple switches. For more examples of template usage see [scarabrc](examples/scarabrc).

Download all non-obsolete attachments of the bug with id `bug_id` to the current directory.

## files
files [-h] [-a] [-s] bug_id

Show list of the files attached to the bug with id `bug_id`. Unless `-a` is specified only non-obsolete attachments are displayed. When `-s` is used, the summary of the attachment is displayed instead of the file name.

Mandatory fields `product`, `component`, `version` should be specified either by command-line switches or as values in templates sections. If multiple templates are specified in one invocation, they are merged with fields each following template overriding values present in the previous ones. Values for the fields provided as a command-line switch override the values in the templates.
