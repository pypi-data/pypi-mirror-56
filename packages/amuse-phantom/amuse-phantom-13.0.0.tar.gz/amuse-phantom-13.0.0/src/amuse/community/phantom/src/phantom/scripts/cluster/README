This folder contains codes used to do analysis on cluster simulations.

Read the header of each file for instructions on how to use each one.
Note: to get the density PDF, you should use phantomanalysis using analysis_MWpdf.f90
      This will give you 'cluster_?????_rho.pdf' files that some of these codes here will use.

General workflow:
      - Make sure you have 'cluster_?????_rho.pdf' files.
      - Use 'rmsmach_vs_time.sh' (providing 'cluster*.log' as input) to get 'rmsmach_vs_time.data' files.
      - Use 'gaussian_fit_pdf.py' to create 'sigma_vs_time.data' files.

      Once you have done this for each run in their folders, you can use the
      iPython Notebooks:

      - 'imfstats.ipynb'    -> calculates/plots the total IMF, given a collection of simulations.
      - 'densityPDFs.ipynb' -> calculates/plots the averaged (with errors) PDF of a collection
                               of simulations, at a specified RMS Mach number.
      - 'pdfstats.ipynb'    -> calculates/plots the averaged: density standard deviation (SD) and
                               RMS Mach number, as functions of time. As well as the
                               density SD as a function of RMS Mach number.
      - 'totmassinsinkstats.ipynb' -> calculates/plots the averaged total mass in sink particles
                                      as a function of time.
