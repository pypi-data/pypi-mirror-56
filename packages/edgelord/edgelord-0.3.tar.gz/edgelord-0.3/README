## About

__TL;DR__: EdgeLord is a Python 3 module for non-voodoo analysis of equities. 

---

Current development focuses on straight forward indicators and signals as opposed to fancy TA indicators that are more akin to strategies themselves or already part of something like ta-lib.  So this module will not be having a `trend_line()` routine or pattern recognition.

It is designed with stocks in mind but will work for any tradable equity with an open, close, low, high and volume; as well the data tested on comes from [Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com/) but you can generate a proper csv file from just about any api or dataset (and I'm not above someone else sending a PR with a script for say iex.)
