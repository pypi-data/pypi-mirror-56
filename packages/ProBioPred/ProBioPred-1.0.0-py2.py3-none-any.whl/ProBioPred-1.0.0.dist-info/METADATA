ProBioPred can uses Virlent factor (VFDB) and CARD database RGI tool to predict virulent  and antibiotic resistence genes. Then it uses pre-trained SVM models to predict potential probiotic/non-probiotic candidates. ProBioPred is available as webserver at http://210.212.161.142/ProBioPred/ and as standalone at https://github.com/microDM/ProBioPred
