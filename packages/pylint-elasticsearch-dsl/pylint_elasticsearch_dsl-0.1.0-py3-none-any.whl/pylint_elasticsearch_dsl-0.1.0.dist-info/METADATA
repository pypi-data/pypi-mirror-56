# pylint-elasticsearch-dsl

[`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org/) plugin for the
[`elasticsearch-dsl`](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package

This plugin is needed to help `pylint` understand the types of some objects of the `elasticsearch-dsl`
package.

Currently, this plugin only patches the false positive `invalid-unary-operand-type` error
that is triggered when writing for example:
```python
from elasticsearch_dsl import Q

~Q("exists", field="foo")
```
See [this issue](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3258) for more details.
