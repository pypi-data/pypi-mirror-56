Description: # pylint-elasticsearch-dsl
        
        [`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org/) plugin for the
        [`elasticsearch-dsl`](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package
        
        This plugin is needed to help `pylint` understand the types of some objects of the `elasticsearch-dsl`
        package.
        
        Currently, this plugin only patches the false positive `invalid-unary-operand-type` error
        that is triggered when writing for example:
        ```python
        from elasticsearch_dsl import Q
        
        ~Q("exists", field="foo")
        ```
        See [this issue](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3258) for more details.
