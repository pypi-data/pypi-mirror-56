          was created. When a policy has more than one version, this field contains the date and
          time when the most recent policy version was created.

        - **PolicyVersionList** *(list) --*

          A list containing information about the versions of the policy.

          - *(dict) --*

            Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

            This data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePolicyVersion ,
            GetPolicyVersion ,  ListPolicyVersions , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.

            For more information about managed policies, refer to `Managed Policies and Inline
            Policies
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in
            the *IAM User Guide* .

            - **Document** *(string) --*

              The policy document.

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and
              GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the
              CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations.

              The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986
              <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to
              convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use
              the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK.
              Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              The identifier for the policy version.

              Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy
              is created, the first policy version is ``v1`` .

            - **IsDefaultVersion** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ ,
              when the policy version was created.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated,
      you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to
      retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results
      even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after
      every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

    - **Marker** *(string) --*

      When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for
      the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
              ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and
              ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist
              of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically,
              many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

              .. note::

                AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an
                array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                interpret the value in your code.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated,
      you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to
      retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results
      even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after
      every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

    - **Marker** *(string) --*

      When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for
      the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

          - **MaxSessionDuration** *(integer) --*

            The maximum session duration (in seconds) for the specified role. Anyone who uses the
            AWS CLI, or API to assume the role can specify the duration using the optional
            ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter.

          - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --*

            The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the role.

            For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions Boundaries for IAM

            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in
            the *IAM User Guide* .

            - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --*

              The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used
              as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of
              ``Policy`` .

            - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --*

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

          - **Tags** *(list) --*

            A list of tags that are attached to the specified role. For more information about
            tagging, see `Tagging IAM Identities
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User
            Guide* .

            - *(dict) --*

              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with a
              resource such as an IAM user or role. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging
              IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in
              the *IAM User Guide* .

              - **Key** *(string) --*

                The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For
                example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

              - **Value** *(string) --*

                The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
                ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and
                ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist
                of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically,
                many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                .. note::

                  AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store
                  an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                  interpret the value in your code.

          - **RoleLastUsed** *(dict) --*

            Contains information about the last time that an IAM role was used. This includes the
            date and time and the Region in which the role was last used. Activity is only reported
            for the trailing 400 days. This period can be shorter if your Region began supporting
            these features within the last year. The role might have been used more than 400 days
            ago. For more information, see `Regions Where Data Is Tracked
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period>`__

                  consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company.
                  Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different
                  values.

                  .. note::

                    AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store
                    an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                    interpret the value in your code.

              supporting these features within the last year. The role might have been used more
              than 400 days ago. For more information, see `Regions Where Data Is Tracked
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period>`__

                The name of the AWS Region in which the role was last used.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated,
      you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to
      retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results
      even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after
      every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

    - **Marker** *(string) --*

      When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for
      the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

          the *IAM User Guide* .

          - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --*

            The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as
            the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of
            ``Policy`` .

          - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --*

            The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

        - **Tags** *(list) --*

          A list of tags that are attached to the specified role. For more information about
          tagging, see `Tagging IAM Identities
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*

          - *(dict) --*

            A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with a
            resource such as an IAM user or role. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging
            IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the

            - **Key** *(string) --*

              The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For
              example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
              ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and
              ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist
              of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically,
              many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

              .. note::

                AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an
                array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                interpret the value in your code.

        - **RoleLastUsed** *(dict) --*

          Contains information about the last time that an IAM role was used. This includes the date
          and time and the Region in which the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the
          trailing 400 days. This period can be shorter if your Region began supporting these
          features within the last year. The role might have been used more than 400 days ago. For

          not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date
          and time the most recent password was used.

          This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers operations.

        - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --*

          The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

          For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions Boundaries for IAM
          Identities

          the *IAM User Guide* .

          - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --*

            The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as
            the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of
            ``Policy`` .

          - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --*

            The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

        - **Tags** *(list) --*

          A list of tags that are associated with the specified user. For more information about
          tagging, see `Tagging IAM Identities
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*
          .

          - *(dict) --*

            A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with a
            resource such as an IAM user or role. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging
            IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the
            *IAM User Guide* .

            - **Key** *(string) --*

              The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For
              example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
              ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and
              ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist
              of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically,
              many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

              .. note::

                AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an
                array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                interpret the value in your code.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated,
      you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to
      retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results
      even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after
      every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

    - **Marker** *(string) --*

      When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for
      the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

              resource such as an IAM user or role. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging
              IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in
              the *IAM User Guide* .

              - **Key** *(string) --*

                The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For
                example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

              - **Value** *(string) --*

                The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
                ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and
                ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist
                of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically,
                many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                .. note::

                  AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store
                  an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                  interpret the value in your code.

        - **EnableDate** *(datetime) --*

          The date and time on which the virtual MFA device was enabled.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated,
      you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to
      retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results
      even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after
      every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

    - **Marker** *(string) --*

      When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true`` , this element is present and contains the value to use for
      the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

            IAM Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the
            *IAM User Guide* .

            - **Key** *(string) --*

              The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For
              example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
              ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources`` , ``Accounting`` , and
              ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist
              of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically,
              many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

              .. note::

                AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an
                array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                interpret the value in your code.

            For more information about managed policies, refer to `Managed Policies and Inline
            Policies
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in
            the *IAM User Guide* .

            - **Document** *(string) --*

              The policy document.

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPolicyVersion and
              GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the
              CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations.

              The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986
              <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__ . You can use a URL decoding method to
              convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use
              the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK.
              Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              The identifier for the policy version.

              Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy

              when the policy version was created.

    - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

      A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated,
      you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to
      retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results
      even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after
      every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

                  and ``Support`` . Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that
                  consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company.
                  Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different
                  values.

                  .. note::

                    AWS always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store
                    an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must
                    interpret the value in your code.

    SimulatePrincipalPolicy `` .

    - **EvalActionName** *(string) --*

      The name of the API operation tested on the indicated resource.

    - **EvalResourceName** *(string) --*

      The ARN of the resource that the indicated API operation was tested on.

    - **EvalDecision** *(string) --*

      The result of the simulation.

    - **MatchedStatements** *(list) --*

      A list of the statements in the input policies that determine the result for this scenario.
      Remember that even if multiple statements allow the operation on the resource, if only one
      statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny overrides any allow. In addition, the
      deny statement is the only entry included in the result.

      - *(dict) --*

        Contains a reference to a ``Statement`` element in a policy document that determines the
        result of the simulation.

        This data type is used by the ``MatchedStatements`` member of the ``  EvaluationResult ``
        type.

      A list of context keys that are required by the included input policies but that were not
      provided by one of the input parameters. This list is used when the resource in a simulation
      is "*", either explicitly, or when the ``ResourceArns`` parameter blank. If you include a list
      of resources, then any missing context values are instead included under the
