    Fold over the results of effects, left-to-right.

    This is like :func:`functools.reduce`, but instead of acting on plain
    values, it acts on the results of effects.

    The function ``f`` will be called with the accumulator (starting with
    ``initial``) and a result of an effect repeatedly for each effect. The
    result of the previous call will be passed as the accumulator to the next
    call.

    For example, the following code evaluates to an Effect of 6::

        fold_effect(operator.add, 0, [Effect(Constant(1)),
                                      Effect(Constant(2)),
