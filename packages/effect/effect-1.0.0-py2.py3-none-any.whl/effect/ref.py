    An effectful mutable variable, suitable for sharing between multiple

    Compare to Haskell's ``IORef`` or Clojure's ``atom``.

    :note: Warning: Instantiating a Reference causes an implicit side-effect.
        In other words, ``Reference`` is not a referentially transparent
        function, and you can't use equational reasoning on it: a call to
        Reference is not interchangeable with the *result of* a call to
        Reference, since identity matters. If you want to create references in
        purely functional code, you can use the :obj:`effect.Func` intent:
        `effect.Effect(effect.Func(Reference, initial))`.
