    :func:`effect.threads.perform_parallel_with_pool` can perform blocking
    performers in a thread pool.

    Note that any performer for this intent will need to be compatible with
    performers for all of its child effects' intents. Notably, if child effects
    have blocking performers, the threaded performer should be used, and if
    they're asynchronous, the asynchronous performer should be used.

    - it's harder to test, since the only thing you can do is call the
      function, instead of inspect its data.
    - it doesn't offer any ability for changing the way the effect is
      performed.

    If you use Func in your application code, know that you are giving
    up some ease of testing and flexibility. It's preferable to represent your
    intents as inert objects with public attributes of simple data. However,
    this is useful for integrating wih "legacy" side-effecting code in a quick
    way.
