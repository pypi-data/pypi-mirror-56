    Perform an effect and invoke callbacks bound to it. You probably don't want
    to use this. Instead, use :func:`sync_perform` (or, if you're using
    Twisted, see the `txeffect`_ library).

    The dispatcher will be called with the intent, and is expected to return a
    performer (another callable). See :obj:`TypeDispatcher` and
    :obj:`ComposedDispatcher` for some implementations of dispatchers, and
    :obj:`effect.base_dispatcher` for a dispatcher supporting basic intents
    like :obj:`Constant` et al.

    The performer will often be decorated with :func:`sync_performer` or the
    ``deferred_performer`` from `txeffect`_ and will be invoked with the
    dispatcher [#dispatcher]_ and the intent, and should perform the desired
    effect. [#box]_ The performer should return the result of the effect, or
    raise an exception, and the result will be passed on to the first callback,
    then the result of the first callback will be passed to the next callback,
    and so on.

    .. _`txeffect`: https://warehouse.python.org/project/txeffect

    Both performers and callbacks may return regular values, raise exceptions,
    or return another Effect, which will be recursively performed, such that
    the result of the returned Effect becomes the result passed to the next
    callback. In the case of exceptions, the next error-callback will be called
    with the exception instance.

    :returns: None

    .. [#dispatcher] The dispatcher is passed because some performers need to
       make recursive calls to :func:`perform`, because they need to perform
       other effects (see :func:`parallel` and
       :func:`.parallel_async.perform_parallel_async` for an example of this).

    .. [#box] Without using one of those decorators, the performer is actually
       passed three arguments, not two: the dispatcher, the intent, and a
       "box". The box is an object that lets the performer provide the result,
       optionally asynchronously. To provide the result, use
       ``box.succeed(result)`` or ``box.fail(exc)``, where ``exc`` is
       an exception. Decorators like :func:`sync_performer` simply abstract this away.
