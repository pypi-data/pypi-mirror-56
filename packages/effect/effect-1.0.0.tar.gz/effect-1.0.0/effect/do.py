An imperative-looking notation for Effectful code.

def do(f):
    """
    A decorator which allows you to use ``do`` notation in your functions, for
    imperative-looking code::

        @do
        def foo():
            thing = yield Effect(Constant(1))
            yield do_return('the result was %r' % (thing,))

        eff = foo()
        return eff.on(...)

    ``@do`` must decorate a generator function (not any other type of
    iterator). Any yielded values must either be Effects or the result of a
    :func:`do_return` call. The result of a yielded Effect will be passed back
    into the generator as the result of the ``yield`` expression. Yielded
    :func:`do_return` values will provide the ultimate result of the Effect
    that is returned by the decorated function. Note that :func:`do_return` is
    only necessary for Python 2 compatibility; return statements can be used
    directly in Python 3-only code.

    It's important to note that any generator function decorated by ``@do``
    will no longer return a generator, but instead it will return an Effect,
    which must be used just like any other Effect.

    Errors are also converted to normal exceptions::

        @do
        def foo():
            try:
                thing = yield Effect(Error(RuntimeError('foo')))
            except RuntimeError:
                yield do_return('got a RuntimeError as expected')

    (This decorator is named for Haskell's ``do`` notation, which is similar in
    spirit).
