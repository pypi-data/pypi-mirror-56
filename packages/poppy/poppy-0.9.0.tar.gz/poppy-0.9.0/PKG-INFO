Description: Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon (POPPY)
        
        POPPY is a Python package that simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction.
        It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction
        and point spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes.
        POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for JWST, but is more broadly applicable to many kinds of
        imaging simulations.
        
        Developed by Marshall Perrin and colleagues at STScI, for use simulating the James Webb Space Telescope
        and other NASA missions.
