Description: Project description
        Movement detector for RaspberryPi with Watch to watch objects coming into proximity.
        Pass pins Trigger and Echo. Pass offset to determine boundary for the object to come in
        
        Example
        from pymitter import EventEmitter
        
        ee = EventEmitter()
        
        # decorator usage
        @ee.on("myevent")
        def handler1(arg):
            print "handler1 called with", arg
        
        # callback usage
        def handler2(arg):
            print "handler2 called with", arg
        ee.on("myotherevent", handler2)
        
        # emit
        ee.emit("myevent", "foo")
        # -> "handler1 called with foo"
        
        ee.emit("myotherevent", "bar")
        # -> "handler2 called with bar"
