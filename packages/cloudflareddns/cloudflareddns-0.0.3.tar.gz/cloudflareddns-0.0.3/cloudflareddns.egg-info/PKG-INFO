        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dvershinin/cloudflareddns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dvershinin/cloudflareddns)
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cloudflareddns.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cloudflareddns)
        
        A tiny command line utility for implementing DDNS with Cloudflare.
        
        * Supports virtually any server that is capable of running Python
        * Synology DiskStations supported
        * Quick to install using `pip`
        
        ## Synopsys
        
        ```
        usage: cloudflareddns [-h] [--email EMAIL] [--key KEY] [--hostname HOSTNAME]
                              [--ip IP] [--ttl TTL] [--verbose] [--version]
        
        Update DDNS in Cloudflare.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help           show this help message and exit
          --email EMAIL        Cloudflare account emai
          --key KEY            Cloudflare API key
          --hostname HOSTNAME  Hostname to set IP for
          --ip IP              The IP address
          --ttl TTL
          --verbose
          --version            show program's version number and exit
        ```
        
        ### Install and use with Synology DiskStations
        
        You can configure a Synology DiskStation with CloudFlare DDNS.
        
        **It's worth noting that if your Synology DSM is recent enough, you can simply use Synology's own DDNS service, then create a `CNAME` record at your domain that points to it. The downside to this solution, however, is extra DNS lookup required to resolve domain to IP.**
        
        Alternative solution is to use `cloudflaredns` which ships with the necessary CLI interface for Synology compatibility: `cloudflareddns-syno`.
            
        #### Step 1. Access Synology via SSH
        
        * Login to your DSM
        * Go to Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service
        * Use your client or commandline to access Synology. If you don't have any, I recommend you try out Putty for Windows.
        * Use your Synology admin account to connect.
        
        #### Step 2. Install `cloudflareddns`
        
        If you're not a lazy man, checkout [instructions on installing using virtualenv](SAFE-INSTALL.md) for this step.
        For quick setup instead:
        
            curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
            pip install cloudflareddns
        
        Run the following command to add new DDNS provider:
        
        ```
        cat >> /etc/ddns_provider.conf << 'EOF'
        [USER_Cloudflare]
                modulepath=/bin/cloudflareddns-syno
                queryurl=https://www.cloudflare.com/
        EOF
        ```
        
        #### Step 3. Get Cloudflare parameters
        
        Go to your account setting page and get API Key.
        
        #### Step 4. Setup DDNS
        
        * Login to your DSM
        * Go to Control Panel > External Access > DDNS > Add
        * Select Cloudflare as service provider. Enter your domain as hostname, your Cloudflare account as Username/Email, and API key as Password/Key
            
        
        ### Installation for CentOS 7
        
            yum install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-el7-latest.rpm
            yum install python2-cloudflareddns
            
        ### Installation for other systems
        
        Installing with `pip` is easiest:
        
            pip install cloudflareddns
        
        ### Usage in Python scripts
        
        ```python
        from cloudflareddns import cloudflareddns
        hostname = 'foo.example.com'
        ip = '1.2.3.4'
        if cloudflareddns.updateRecord(hostname, ip):
          print('Record is OK')
          ...
        ```
        
        Requires using environment variables (see tips below).
        
        ### Tips
        
        In non-Synology system, it's best to place your Cloudflare credentials into `~/.bashrc` as opposed
        to passing them on the command-line. A `.bashrc` may have:
        
        ```bash
        export CF_EMAIL="john@example.com"
        export CF_KEY="xxxxxx"
        ```
        
        Don't forget to `source ~/.bashrc` if you have just put credentials in there.
        The `cloudflareddns` will pick those up, so no need to pass `--email` or `--key` every time.
