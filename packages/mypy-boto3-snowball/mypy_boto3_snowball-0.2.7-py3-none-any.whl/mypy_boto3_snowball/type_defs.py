    With ``EXPORT`` jobs, you specify the bucket or buckets that your transferred data will be
    exported from. Optionally, you can also specify a ``KeyRange`` value. If you choose to export a
    range, you define the length of the range by providing either an inclusive ``BeginMarker`` value,
    an inclusive ``EndMarker`` value, or both. Ranges are UTF-8 binary sorted.
