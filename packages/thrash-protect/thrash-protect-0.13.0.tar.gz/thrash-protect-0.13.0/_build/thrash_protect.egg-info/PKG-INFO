Description: The script attempts to detect thrashing situations and temporary stop rogue processes, 
        hopefully before things get too much out of control, hopefully giving a sysadm enough time 
        to investigate and handle the situation if there is a sysadm around, and if not - hopefully 
        allowing boxes to become just slightly degraded instead of completely thrashed, all until the offending 
        processes ends or the oom killer kicks in.
        
        As of 2014-09, the development seems to have stagnated - for the very simple reason that 
        it seems to work well enough for me.
