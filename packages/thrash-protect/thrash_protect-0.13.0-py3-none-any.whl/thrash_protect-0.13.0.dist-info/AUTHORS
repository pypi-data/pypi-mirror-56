Thrash-protect was initially written in late 2013 by Tobias Brox while
working at Redpill-Linpro.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

    * Tobias Brox

Other significant contributors:

    * Bj√∏rn Pettersen - quick code review and constructive criticism
    * Xavier Martin - done some work on prettify the logging a bit
    * wyg3958 - code cleanup
    * Riccardo Balbo - bugfixing, ref https://github.com/tobixen/thrash-protect/pull/7
    * Unnamed colleague - for setting up swap and not editing the MaxClients setting under apache on a production server running some php application, such that we got downtime due to thrashing - wouldn't have made thrash-protect without this one.
    * Unnamed employee at an unnamed customer - for bypassing our job-scheduling system and running some very memory-intensive processes directly on some of the computing nodes, repeatedly causing nodes to go down due to thrashing.  (thrash-protect eventually did allow his processes to complete, without downtime or further manual work).
