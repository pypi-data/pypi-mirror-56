Description: # üñãÔ∏è Pen - your command line diary
        
        Pen allows you to quickly jot down your thoughts right from the command line. 
        All your journals will be stored as text, which means you can simply put them into cloud storage
        or on a USB flash drive and access it from anywhere, even without pen itself. 
        It takes a lot of inspiration from [jrnl](https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl) and
        tries to create a similar interface that is just as easy to use, but Pen is 
        rewritten from the ground up in modern Python, aiming for a more stable 
        and enhanced experience. Currently, Pen is still in an early stage, but some
        nice additional features are planned. 
        Windows is currently not supported. If you are on Windows (and not using WSL) and want 
        to use Pen, leave an issue on GitHub and ask for support. 
        
        ## Journaling
        Writing about your daily routine has been linked to therapeutic health benefits 
        like stress reduction
        [[1]](#1) [[2]](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/writing).
        For years, practitioners have used logs, questionnaires, journals and other
        writing forms to help people heal from stresses and traumas.
        It's not necessary to journal every single day, because it should not become a
        burden.
        However, when you feel like it would help get things off your mind, 
        when you feel stressed by something or when you just want to go through an 
        experience in your head again before forgetting too many details, writing it
        down can be a very relieving and helpful experience.
        
        Pen is also great just as a simple note-keeping app. You could for example 
        create a journal called 'code' where you briefly describe the cool new library 
        you learnt about today so you can go back to it later, or to describe how you 
        solved a difficult programming problem.  
        
        You can also use Pen to track progress in your work, in the gym or 
        on the race track. Having a place to note your achievements, personal records 
        or how much weight you lost over time is a great motivator, as you can
        always look back and see how fast you progressed.
        
        
        ## Using Pen
        To make a new entry, just type:
        ```
        pen
        ```
        If you haven't run Pen on this machine before, a short setup dialog will start, 
        asking about your preferences like which editor you want to use. Pen will 
        always try to infer these settings from your environment variables and only ask
        when necessary. You can always change the way Pen behaves by changing its 
        configuration which is by default located at `$HOME/.config/pen`. You can also
        change the config file's location by exporting the `PEN_HOME` environment
        variable before running `pen`. This is especially useful if you want to sync
        your config using Dropbox, Google Cloud or a different cloud storage service.
