Description: OpenModes
        =========
        
        A Method of Moments (Boundary Element Method) code designed to find the
        modes of open resonators such as meta-atoms (the building blocks of
        metamaterials), (nano) antennas, scattering particles etc. Using these
        modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
        excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily.
