# instaffo-scikit-learn

instaffo-scikit-learn is a Python package that contains transformers and estimators that are compatible with the popular machine learning package [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).

scikit-learn is the foundation of many machine learning projects here at [Instaffo](https://instaffo.com/) and we are huge fans of the tool. As we sometimes reach the limits of what is possible out of the box, we regularly create custom classes that we have decided to make open source. Please check the [license](LICENSE) for more details.
